It is also designed to enable the use of the coded video \nrepresentation in a flexible manner for a wide variety of network environments. The use of this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard allows motion video to be manipulated as a form of computer data and to be stored on various \nstorage media, transmitted and received over existing and future networks and distributed on existing and future \nbroadcasting channels. \nThe revision approved 2005-03 contained modifications of the video coding standard to add four new profiles, referred to \nas the High, High 10, High 4:2:2, and High 4:4:4 profiles, to improve video quality capability and to extend the range of \napplications addressed by the standard (for example, by including support for a greater range of picture sample precision \nand higher-resolution chroma formats). Additionally, a definition of new types of supplemental data was specified to \nfurther broaden the applicability of the video coding standard. Finally, a number of corrections to errors in the published \ntext were included. \nCorrigendum 1 to Rec. ITU-T H.264 corrected and updated various minor aspects to bring the ITU-T version of the text \nup to date relative to the April 2005 output status approved as a new edition of the corresponding jointly-developed and \ntechnically-aligned text ISO/IEC 14496-10. It additionally fixed a number of minor errors and needs for clarification and \ndefined three previously-reserved sample aspect ratio indicators. \nAmendment 1 \"Support of additional colour spaces and removal of the High 4:4:4 Profile\" contained alterations to Rec. \nITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 Advanced Video Coding to specify the support of additional colour spaces and to remove \nthe definition of the High 4:4:4 profile. \nNOTE \u2013 Rec. ITU-T H.264 is a twin text with ISO/IEC 14496-10 and this amendment was published in two different \ndocuments in the ISO/IEC series: \n\u2013  The removal of the High 4:4:4 profile was found in ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005/Cor.2. \n\u2013  The specification for support of additional colour spaces was found in ISO/IEC 14496-10:2005/Amd.1. \nAmendment 2 \"New profiles for professional applications\" contained extensions to Rec. ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 \nAdvanced Video Coding to specify the support of five additional profiles intended primarily for professional applications \n(the High 10 Intra, High 4:2:2 Intra, High 4:4:4 Intra, CAVLC 4:4:4 Intra, and High 4:4:4 Predictive profiles) and two new \ntypes of supplemental enhancement information (SEI) messages (the post-filter hint SEI message and the tone mapping \ninformation SEI message). \nAmendment 3 \"Scalable video coding\" contained extensions to Rec. ITU-T H.264 | ISO/IEC 14496-10 Advanced Video \nCoding to specify a scalable video coding extension in three profiles (the Scalable Baseline, Scalable High, and Scalable \nHigh Intra profiles). \nThe edition of ITU-T H.264 published in 2005-11 included the text approved 2005-03 and its Corrigendum 1 approved \n2005-09. ITU-T H.264 (2005) Amd.2 (2007) was available only as pre-published text since it was superseded by \nITU-T H.264 Amd.3 (2007-11) before its publication; further, ITU-T H.264 Amd.3 was not published separately. This \nthird edition integrated into the ITU-T H.264 edition published in 2005-11 all changes approved in Amendments 1 (2006-\n06), 2 (2007-04) and 3 (2007-11). \nCorrigendum 1 (2009) provides a significant number of minor corrections, clarifications, consistency improvements and \nformatting improvements drafted in response to accumulated errata reports collected since publication of the 2nd edition \n(dated 2005-03, which included a Cor.1 approved 2005-09). \nThe edition of ITU-T H.264 published in 2009-05 contained enhancement extensions to support multiview video coding \n(MVC), specification of a \"Constrained Baseline Profile\", and some miscellaneous corrections and clarifications. \nThe edition of ITU-T H.264 published in 2010-03 contained the specification of a new profile (the Stereo High profile) for \ntwo-view video coding with support of interlaced coding tools, the specification a new SEI message (the frame packing \narrangement SEI message), and some miscellaneous corrections and clarifications. \nThe edition of ITU-T H.264 approved in 2011-06 contained the specification of a new level (Level 5.2) supporting higher \nprocessing rates in terms of maximum macroblocks per second, a new profile (the Progressive High profile) to enable \n \n\nimplementation of decoders supporting only the frame coding tools of the previously specified High profile, and included \nmiscellaneous corrections and clarifications. \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2012-01 contained the specification of three additional profiles intended \nprimarily for communication applications (the Constrained High, Scalable Constrained Baseline, and Scalable Constrained \nHigh profiles). \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2013-04 contained an additional profile for multiview video coding with \ndepth information (the Multiview Depth High profile), and contained additional SEI message enhancements, additional \ncolorimetry identifiers, and corrections and clarifications. \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2014-02 specified multi-resolution frame-compatible (MFC) enhancement \nfor stereoscopic video coding, including the specification of an additional profile, the MFC High profile, an enhanced \nprofile for combined multiview video coding with depth information (the Enhanced Multiview Depth High profile), and \nincludes miscellaneous minor corrections and clarifications. \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2016-02 specified MFC stereoscopic video with depth maps, including the \nspecification of an additional profile, the MFC Depth High profile, and the mastering display colour volume SEI message, \nadditional colour-related video usability information codepoint identifiers, and miscellaneous minor corrections and \nclarifications. \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264 approved in 2016-10, specified additional levels of decoder capability supporting larger \npicture sizes (Levels 6, 6.1, and 6.2), the green metadata SEI message, the alternative depth information SEI message, \nadditional colour-related video usability information codepoint identifiers, and miscellaneous minor corrections and \nclarifications. \nThe edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2017-04, specified the Progressive High 10 profile; support for additional \ncolour-related indicators including the hybrid log-gamma transfer characteristics indication, the alternative transfer \ncharacteristics SEI message, the IC C  colour matrix transformation, chromaticity-derived constant luminance and non-\nT P\nconstant luminance colour matrix coefficients, the colour remapping information SEI message; and miscellaneous minor \ncorrections and clarifications. \nThis edition of Rec. ITU-T H.264, approved in 2019-05, specifies additional SEI messages for ambient viewing \nenvironment, content light level information, content colour volume, equirectangular projection, cubemap projection, \nsphere rotation, region-wise packing, omnidirectional viewport, SEI manifest, and SEI prefix, and miscellaneous minor \ncorrections and clarifications. \nHistory \nEdition  Recommendation  Approval  Study Group  Unique ID* \n",

The  ITU  Telecommunication \nStandardization Sector (ITU-T) is a permanent organ of ITU. ITU-T is responsible for studying technical, \noperating  and  tariff  questions  and  issuing  Recommendations  on  them  with  a  view  to  standardizing \ntelecommunications on a worldwide basis. \nThe World Telecommunication Standardization Assembly (WTSA), which meets every four years, establishes \nthe topics for study by the ITU-T study groups which, in turn, produce Recommendations on these topics. \nThe approval of ITU-T Recommendations is covered by the procedure laid down in WTSA Resolution 1. \nIn some areas of information technology which fall within ITU-T's purview, the necessary standards are \nprepared on a collaborative basis with ISO and IEC. \n \n \n \nNOTE \nIn  this  Recommendation,  the  expression  \"Administration\"  is  used  for  conciseness  to  indicate  both  a \ntelecommunication administration and a recognized operating agency. \nCompliance with this Recommendation is voluntary. However, the Recommendation may contain certain \nmandatory  provisions  (to  ensure,  e.g.,  interoperability  or  applicability)  and  compliance  with  the \nRecommendation is achieved when all of these mandatory provisions are met. The words \"shall\" or some other \nobligatory language such as \"must\" and the negative equivalents are used to express requirements. The use of \nsuch words does not suggest that compliance with the Recommendation is required of any party. \n \n \n \n \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS\uf020\nITU draws attention to the possibility that the practice or implementation of this Recommendation may involve \nthe use of a claimed Intellectual Property Right. ITU takes no position concerning the evidence, validity or \napplicability of claimed Intellectual Property Rights, whether asserted by ITU members or others outside of the \nRecommendation development process. \nAs of the date of approval of this Recommendation, ITU had received notice of intellectual property, protected \nby patents, which may be required to implement this Recommendation. However, implementers are cautioned \nthat this may not represent the latest information and are therefore strongly urged to consult the TSB patent \ndatabase at http://www.itu.int/ITU-T/ipr/. \n \n \n \n\uf0e3 ITU 2019 \nAll rights reserved.

In the \nITU-T, the changes for version 26 were approved on 13 June 2019. \n0.5  Profiles and levels \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThis Recommendation | International Standard is designed to be generic in the sense that it serves a wide range of \napplications, bit rates, resolutions, qualities, and services. Applications should cover, among other things, digital storage \nmedia, television broadcasting and real-time communications. In the course of creating this Specification, various \nrequirements from typical applications have been considered, necessary algorithmic elements have been developed, and \nthese have been integrated into a single syntax. Hence, this Specification will facilitate video data interchange among \ndifferent applications. \nConsidering the practicality of implementing the full syntax of this Specification, however, a limited number of subsets of \nthe syntax are also stipulated by means of \"profiles\" and \"levels\". These and other related terms are formally defined in \nclause 3. \nA \"profile\" is a subset of the entire bitstream syntax that is specified by this Recommendation | International Standard. \nWithin the bounds imposed by the syntax of a given profile it is still possible to require a very large variation in the \nperformance of encoders and decoders depending upon the values taken by syntax elements in the bitstream such as the \nspecified size of the decoded pictures. In many applications, it is currently neither practical nor economic to implement a \ndecoder capable of dealing with all hypothetical uses of the syntax within a particular profile. \nIn order to deal with this problem, \"levels\" are specified within each profile. A level is a specified set of constraints imposed \non values of the syntax elements in the bitstream. These constraints may be simple limits on values. Alternatively they \n \n\nmay take the form of constraints on arithmetic combinations of values (e.g., picture width multiplied by picture height \nmultiplied by number of pictures decoded per second). \nCoded video content conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard uses a common syntax. In order to \nachieve a subset of the complete syntax, flags, parameters, and other syntax elements are included in the bitstream that \nsignal the presence or absence of syntactic elements that occur later in the bitstream. \n0.6  Overview of the design characteristics \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThe coded representation specified in the syntax is designed to enable a high compression capability for a desired image \nquality. With the exception of the transform bypass mode of operation for lossless coding in the High 4:4:4 Intra, \nCAVLC 4:4:4 Intra, and High 4:4:4 Predictive profiles, and the I_PCM mode of operation in all profiles, the algorithm is \ntypically not lossless, as the exact source sample values are typically not preserved through the encoding and decoding \nprocesses. A number of techniques may be used to achieve highly efficient compression. Encoding algorithms (not \nspecified in this Recommendation | International Standard) may select between inter and intra coding for block-shaped \nregions of each picture. Inter coding uses motion vectors for block-based inter prediction to exploit temporal statistical \ndependencies between different pictures. Intra coding uses various spatial prediction modes to exploit spatial statistical \ndependencies in the source signal for a single picture. Motion vectors and intra prediction modes may be specified for a \nvariety of block sizes in the picture. The prediction residual is then further compressed using a transform to remove spatial \ncorrelation inside the transform block before it is quantized, producing an irreversible process that typically discards less \nimportant visual information while forming a close approximation to the source samples. Finally, the motion vectors or \nintra prediction modes are combined with the quantized transform coefficient information and encoded using either \nvariable length coding or arithmetic coding. \nScalable video coding is specified in Annex G allowing the construction of bitstreams that contain sub-bitstreams that \nconform to this Specification. For temporal bitstream scalability, i.e., the presence of a sub-bitstream with a smaller \ntemporal sampling rate than the bitstream, complete access units are removed from the bitstream when deriving the \nsub-bitstream. In this case, high-level syntax and inter prediction reference pictures in the bitstream are constructed \naccordingly. For spatial and quality bitstream scalability, i.e., the presence of a sub-bitstream with lower spatial resolution \nor quality than the bitstream, NAL units are removed from the bitstream when deriving the sub-bitstream. In this case, \ninter-layer prediction, i.e., the prediction of the higher spatial resolution or quality signal by data of the lower spatial \nresolution or quality signal, is typically used for efficient coding. Otherwise, the coding algorithm as described in the \nprevious paragraph is used. \nMultiview video coding is specified in Annex H allowing the construction of bitstreams that represent multiple views. \nSimilar to scalable video coding, bitstreams that represent multiple views may also contain sub-bitstreams that conform to \nthis Specification. For temporal bitstream scalability, i.e., the presence of a sub-bitstream with a smaller temporal sampling \nrate than the bitstream, complete access units are removed from the bitstream when deriving the sub-bitstream. In this case, \nhigh-level syntax and inter prediction reference pictures in the bitstream are constructed accordingly. For view bitstream \nscalability, i.e. the presence of a sub-bitstream with fewer views than the bitstream, NAL units are removed from the \nbitstream when deriving the sub-bitstream. In this case, inter-view prediction, i.e., the prediction of one view signal by \ndata of another view signal, is typically used for efficient coding. Otherwise, the coding algorithm as described in the \nprevious paragraph is used. \nAn extension of multiview video coding that additionally supports the inclusion of depth maps is specified in Annex I, \nallowing the construction of bitstreams that represent multiple views with corresponding depth views. In a similar manner, \nas with the multiview video coding specified in Annex H, bitstreams encoded as specified in Annex I may also contain \nsub-bitstreams that conform to this Specification. \nA multiview video coding extension with depth information is specified in Annex J. Sub-bitstreams consisting of a texture \nbase view conform to this Specification, sub-bitstreams consisting of multiple texture views may also conform to Annex H \nof this Specification, and sub-bitstreams consisting of one or more texture views and one or more depth views may also \nconform to Annex I of this Specification. Enhanced texture view coding that utilizes the associated depth views and \ndecoding processes for depth views are specified for this extension. \n0.6.1  Predictive coding \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nBecause of the conflicting requirements of random access and highly efficient compression, two main coding types are \nspecified. Intra coding is done without reference to other pictures. Intra coding may provide access points to the coded \nsequence where decoding can begin and continue correctly, but typically also shows only moderate compression efficiency. \nInter coding (predictive or bi-predictive) is more efficient using inter prediction of each block of sample values from some \npreviously decoded picture selected by the encoder. In contrast to some other video coding standards, pictures coded using \nbi-predictive inter prediction may also be used as references for inter coding of other pictures. \n \n\nThe application of the three coding types to pictures in a sequence is flexible, and the order of the decoding process is \ngenerally not the same as the order of the source picture capture process in the encoder or the output order from the decoder \nfor display. The choice is left to the encoder and will depend on the requirements of the application. The decoding order is \nspecified such that the decoding of pictures that use inter-picture prediction follows later in decoding order than other \npictures that are referenced in the decoding process. \n0.6.2  Coding of progressive and interlaced video \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThis Recommendation | International Standard specifies a syntax and decoding process for video that originated in either \nprogressive-scan or interlaced-scan form, which may be mixed together in the same sequence. The two fields of an \ninterlaced frame are separated in capture time while the two fields of a progressive frame share the same capture time. \nEach field may be coded separately or the two fields may be coded together as a frame. Progressive frames are typically \ncoded as a frame. For interlaced video, the encoder can choose between frame coding and field coding. Frame coding or \nfield coding can be adaptively selected on a picture-by-picture basis and also on a more localized basis within a coded \nframe. Frame coding is typically preferred when the video scene contains significant detail with limited motion. Field \ncoding typically works better when there is fast picture-to-picture motion. \n0.6.3  Picture partitioning into macroblocks and smaller partitions \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nAs in previous video coding Recommendations and International Standards, a macroblock, consisting of a 16x16 block of \nluma samples and two corresponding blocks of chroma samples, is used as the basic processing unit of the video decoding \nprocess. \nA macroblock can be further partitioned for inter prediction. The selection of the size of inter prediction partitions is a \nresult of a trade-off between the coding gain provided by using motion compensation with smaller blocks and the quantity \nof data needed to represent the data for motion compensation. In this Recommendation | International Standard the inter \nprediction process can form segmentations for motion representation as small as 4x4 luma samples in size, using motion \nvector accuracy of one-quarter of the luma sample grid spacing displacement. The process for inter prediction of a sample \nblock can also involve the selection of the picture to be used as the reference picture from a number of stored previously-\ndecoded pictures. Motion vectors are encoded differentially with respect to predicted values formed from nearby encoded \nmotion vectors. \nTypically, the encoder calculates appropriate motion vectors and other data elements represented in the video data stream. \nThis motion estimation process in the encoder and the selection of whether to use inter prediction for the representation of \neach region of the video content is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \n0.6.4  Spatial redundancy reduction \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nBoth source pictures and prediction residuals have high spatial redundancy. This Recommendation | International Standard \nis based on the use of a block-based transform method for spatial redundancy removal. After inter prediction from \npreviously-decoded samples in other pictures or spatial-based prediction from previously-decoded samples within the \ncurrent picture, the resulting prediction residual is split into 4x4 blocks. These are converted into the transform domain \nwhere they are quantized. After quantization many of the transform coefficients are zero or have low amplitude and can \nthus be represented with a small amount of encoded data. The processes of transformation and quantization in the encoder \nare not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \n0.7  How to read this Specification \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nIt is suggested that the reader starts with clause 1 (Scope) and moves on to clause 3 (Definitions). Clause 6 should be read \nfor the geometrical relationship of the source, input, and output of the decoder. Clause 7 (Syntax and semantics) specifies \nthe order to parse syntax elements from the bitstream. See clauses 7.1 to 7.3 for syntactical order and see clause 7.4 for \nsemantics; i.e., the scope, restrictions, and conditions that are imposed on the syntax elements. The actual parsing for most \nsyntax elements is specified in clause 9 (Parsing process). Finally, clause 8 (Decoding process) specifies how the syntax \nelements are mapped into decoded samples. Throughout reading this Specification, the reader should refer to clauses 2 \n(Normative references), 4 (Abbreviations), and 5 (Conventions) as needed. Annexes A through E, G, and H also form an \nintegral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nAnnex A  specifies  fourteen  profiles  (Baseline,  Constrained Baseline,  Main,  Extended,  High,  Progressive High, \nConstrained High,  High 10,  High 4:2:2,  High 4:4:4 Predictive,  High 10 Intra,  High 4:2:2 Intra,  High 4:4:4 Intra,  and \nCAVLC 4:4:4 Intra), each being tailored to certain application domains, and defines the so-called levels of the profiles. \n \n\nAnnex B specifies syntax and semantics of a byte stream format for delivery of coded video as an ordered stream of bytes. \nAnnex C specifies the hypothetical reference decoder and its use to check bitstream and decoder conformance. Annex D \nspecifies syntax and semantics for supplemental enhancement information message payloads.

The reader is referred to Annex G for the entire decoding process for \nSVC, which is specified there with references being made to clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes A to E. Clause G.10 specifies five \nprofiles  for  SVC  (Scalable Baseline,  Scalable Constrained Baseline,  Scalable High,  Scalable Constrained High,  and \nScalable High Intra). \nAnnex H specifies multiview video coding (MVC) and multi-resolution frame compatible stereo coding (MFC). The reader \nis referred to Annex H for the entire decoding process for MVC and MFC, which is specified there with references being \nmade to clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes A to E. Clause H.10 specifies two profiles for MVC (Multiview High and Stereo High) \nand one profile for MFC (MFC High). \nAnnex I specifies MVC extensions for inclusion of depth maps, referred to as multiview video coding with depth (MVCD). \nThe reader is referred to Annex I for the entire decoding process for MVCD, which is specified there with references being \nmade to clauses 2 to 9, Annexes A to E and Annex H. Clause I.10 specifies two profiles for MVCD (Multiview Depth \nHigh and MFC Depth High). \nAnnex J specifies a multiview video coding extension with depth information (3D-AVC). The reader is referred to Annex J \nfor the entire decoding process for 3D-AVC, which is specified there with references being made to clauses 2 to 9 and \nAnnexes A to E and H to I. Clause J.10 specifies one profile for 3D-AVC. \nThroughout this Specification, statements appearing with the preamble \"NOTE -\" are informative and are not an integral \npart of this Recommendation | International Standard. \n1  Scope \nThis document specifies Recommendation ITU-T H.264 | International Standard ISO/IEC 14496-10 Advanced video \ncoding. \n",

Each syntax element is described by its name (all lower case \nletters with underscore characters), its one or two syntax categories, and one or two descriptors for its method of coded \nrepresentation. The decoding process behaves according to the value of the syntax element and to the values of previously \ndecoded syntax elements. When a value of a syntax element is used in the syntax tables or the text, it appears in regular \n(i.e., not bold) type. \nIn some cases the syntax tables may use the values of other variables derived from syntax elements values. Such variables \nappear in the syntax tables, or text, named by a mixture of lower case and upper case letter and without any underscore \ncharacters. Variables starting with an upper case letter are derived for the decoding of the current syntax structure and all \ndepending syntax structures. Variables starting with an upper case letter may be used in the decoding process for later \nsyntax structures without mentioning the originating syntax structure of the variable. Variables starting with a lower case \nletter are only used within the clause in which they are derived. \nIn some cases, \"mnemonic\" names for syntax element values or variable values are used interchangeably with their \nnumerical values. Sometimes \"mnemonic\" names are used without any associated numerical values. The association of \nvalues and names is specified in the text. The names are constructed from one or more groups of letters separated by an \nunderscore character. Each group starts with an upper case letter and may contain more upper case letters. \nNOTE \u2013 The syntax is described in a manner that closely follows the C-language syntactic constructs. \nFunctions that specify properties of the current position in the bitstream are referred to as syntax functions. These functions \nare specified in clause 7.2 and assume the existence of a bitstream pointer with an indication of the position of the next bit \nto be read by the decoding process from the bitstream. Syntax functions are described by their names, which are constructed \nas syntax element names and end with left and right round parentheses including zero or more variable names (for \ndefinition) or values (for usage), separated by commas (if more than one variable). \nFunctions that are not syntax functions (including mathematical functions specified in clause 5.7) are described by their \nnames, which start with an upper case letter, contain a mixture of lower and upper case letters without any underscore \ncharacter, and end with left and right parentheses including zero or more variable names (for definition) or values (for \nusage) separated by commas (if more than one variable). \nSubscripts or square parentheses are used for the indexing of arrays. In reference to a visual depiction of a matrix, the first \nsubscript is used as a row (vertical) index and the second subscript is used as a column (horizontal) index. The indexing \norder is reversed when using square parentheses rather than subscripts for indexing. Thus, an element of a matrix s at \nhorizontal position x and vertical position y may be denoted either as s[ x, y ] or as s . \nyx\n \n\nBinary notation is indicated by enclosing the string of bit values by single quote marks. For example, '01000001' represents \nan eight-bit string having only its second and its last bits (counted from the most to the least significant bit) equal to 1. \nHexadecimal notation, indicated by prefixing the hexadecimal number by \"0x\", may be used instead of binary notation \nwhen the number of bits is an integer multiple of 4. For example, 0x41 represents an eight-bit string having only its second \nand its last bits (counted from the most to the least significant bit) equal to 1. \nNumerical values not enclosed in single quotes and not prefixed by \"0x\" are decimal values. \nA value equal to 0 represents a FALSE condition in a test statement. The value TRUE is represented by any value different \nfrom zero. \n",

            "section_text": "7.2  Specification of syntax functions, categories, and descriptors \n\nThe functions presented here are used in the syntactical description. These functions assume the existence of a bitstream \npointer with an indication of the position of the next bit to be read by the decoding process from the bitstream. \nbyte_aligned( ) is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the current position in the bitstream is on a byte boundary, i.e., the next bit in the bitstream is the first bit in a \nbyte, the return value of byte_aligned( ) is equal to TRUE. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the return value of byte_aligned( ) is equal to FALSE. \nmore_data_in_byte_stream( ), which is used only in the byte stream NAL unit syntax structure specified in Annex B, is \nspecified as follows: \n\u2013  If more data follow in the byte stream, the return value of more_data_in_byte_stream( ) is equal to TRUE. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the return value of more_data_in_byte_stream( ) is equal to FALSE. \nmore_rbsp_data( ) is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If there is no more data in the RBSP, the return value of more_rbsp_data( ) is equal to FALSE. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the RBSP data is searched for the last (least significant, right-most) bit equal to 1 that is present in the \nRBSP. Given the position of this bit, which is the first bit (rbsp_stop_one_bit) of the rbsp_trailing_bits( ) syntax \nstructure, the following applies: \n\u2013  If there is more data in an RBSP before the rbsp_trailing_bits( ) syntax structure, the return value of \nmore_rbsp_data( ) is equal to TRUE. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the return value of more_rbsp_data( ) is equal to FALSE. \nThe method for enabling determination of whether there is more data in the RBSP is specified by the application (or \nin Annex B for applications that use the byte stream format). \nmore_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If there is more data in an RBSP, the return value of more_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is equal to TRUE. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the return value of more_rbsp_trailing_data( ) is equal to FALSE. \nnext_bits( n ) provides the next bits in the bitstream for comparison purposes, without advancing the bitstream pointer. \nProvides a look at the next n bits in the bitstream with n being its argument. When used within the byte stream as specified \nin Annex B, next_bits( n ) returns a value of 0 if fewer than n bits remain within the byte stream. \nread_bits( n ) reads the next n bits from the bitstream and advances the bitstream pointer by n bit positions. When n is \nequal to 0, read_bits( n ) is specified to return a value equal to 0 and to not advance the bitstream pointer. \nCategories (labelled in the table as C) specify the partitioning of slice data into at most three slice data partitions. Slice \ndata partition A contains all syntax elements of category 2. Slice data partition B contains all syntax elements of category 3. \nSlice data partition C contains all syntax elements of category 4. The meaning of other category values is not specified. \nFor some syntax elements, two category values, separated by a vertical bar, are used. In these cases, the category value to \nbe applied is further specified in the text. For syntax structures used within other syntax structures, the categories of all \nsyntax elements found within the included syntax structure are listed, separated by a vertical bar. A syntax element or \nsyntax structure with category marked as \"All\" is present within all syntax structures that include that syntax element or \nsyntax structure. For syntax structures used within other syntax structures, a numeric category value provided in a syntax \ntable at the location of the inclusion of a syntax structure containing a syntax element with category marked as \"All\" is \nconsidered to apply to the syntax elements with category \"All\". \n \n\nThe following descriptors specify the parsing process of each syntax element. For some syntax elements, two descriptors, \nseparated by a vertical bar, are used. In these cases, the left descriptors apply when entropy_coding_mode_flag is equal \nto 0 and the right descriptor applies when entropy_coding_mode_flag is equal to 1. \n\u2013  ae(v): context-adaptive arithmetic entropy-coded syntax element. The parsing process for this descriptor is \nspecified in clause 9.3. \n\u2013  b(8): byte having any pattern of bit string (8 bits). The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return \nvalue of the function read_bits( 8 ). \n\u2013  ce(v): context-adaptive variable-length entropy-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process \nfor this descriptor is specified in clause 9.2. \n\u2013  f(n): fixed-pattern bit string using n bits written (from left to right) with the left bit first. The parsing process for \nthis descriptor is specified by the return value of the function read_bits( n ). \n\u2013  i(n): signed integer using n bits. When n is \"v\" in the syntax table, the number of bits varies in a manner dependent \non the value of other syntax elements. The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return value of \nthe function read_bits( n ) interpreted as a two's complement integer representation with most significant bit \nwritten first. \n\u2013  me(v): mapped Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this descriptor \nis specified in clause 9.1. \n\u2013  se(v): signed integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this \ndescriptor is specified in clause 9.1. \n\u2013  te(v): truncated Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with left bit first. The parsing process for this descriptor is \nspecified in clause 9.1. \n\u2013  u(n): unsigned integer using n bits. When n is \"v\" in the syntax table, the number of bits varies in a manner \ndependent on the value of other syntax elements. The parsing process for this descriptor is specified by the return \nvalue of the function read_bits( n ) interpreted as a binary representation of an unsigned integer with most \nsignificant bit written first. \n\u2013  ue(v): unsigned integer Exp-Golomb-coded syntax element with the left bit first. The parsing process for this \ndescriptor is specified in clause 9.1. \n \n\n",

In \naddition, syntax elements with syntax category \"All\" may be present, as determined by the syntax and semantics of the \nRBSP data structure.

No decoding process for these values of \nnal_unit_type is specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. Since different applications might use NAL unit types \n0 and 24..31 for different purposes, particular care must be exercised in the design of encoders that generate NAL units with \nnal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive, and in the design of decoders that interpret the content of NAL units \nwith nal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive. \nDecoders shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and discard) the contents of all NAL units that use reserved values of \nnal_unit_type. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 This requirement allows future definition of compatible extensions to this Recommendation | International Standard. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 In previous editions of this Recommendation | International Standard, the NAL unit types 13..15 and 19..20 (or a subset \nof these NAL unit types) were reserved and no decoding process for NAL units having these values of nal_unit_type was specified. \nIn later editions of this Recommendation | International Standard, currently reserved values of nal_unit_type might become non-\nreserved and a decoding process for these values of nal_unit_type might be specified. Encoders should take into consideration that \nthe values of nal_unit_type that were reserved in previous editions of this Recommendation | International Standard might be ignored \nby decoders. \nIn the text, coded slice NAL unit collectively refers to a coded slice of a non-IDR picture NAL unit or to a coded slice of \nan IDR picture NAL unit. The variable IdrPicFlag is specified as \nIdrPicFlag = ( ( nal_unit_type  = =  5 )  ?  1  :  0 )    (7-1) \nWhen the value of nal_unit_type is equal to 5 for a NAL unit containing a slice of a particular picture, the picture shall not \ncontain NAL units with nal_unit_type in the range of 1 to 4, inclusive. For coded video sequences conforming to one or \nmore of the profiles specified in Annex A that are decoded using the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, such a \npicture is referred to as an IDR picture. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 Slice data partitioning cannot be used for IDR pictures. \nsvc_extension_flag indicates whether a nal_unit_header_svc_extension( ) or nal_unit_header_mvc_extension( ) will \nfollow next in the syntax structure. \nWhen svc_extension_flag is not present, the value of svc_extension_flag is inferred to be equal to 0. \nThe value of svc_extension_flag shall be equal to 1 for coded video sequences conforming to one or more profiles specified \nin Annex G. Decoders conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex G shall ignore (remove from the bitstream \nand discard) NAL units for which nal_unit_type is equal to 14 or 20 and for which svc_extension_flag is equal to 0. \nThe value of svc_extension_flag shall be equal to 0 for coded video sequences conforming to one or more profiles specified \nin Annex H. Decoders conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex H shall ignore (remove from the bitstream \nand discard) NAL units for which nal_unit_type is equal to 14 or 20 and for which svc_extension_flag is equal to 1. \nThe value of svc_extension_flag shall be equal to 0 for coded video sequences conforming to one or more profiles specified \nin Annex I. Decoders conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex I shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and \ndiscard) NAL units for which nal_unit_type is equal to 14, 20, or 21 and for which svc_extension_flag is equal to 1. \nThe value of svc_extension_flag shall be equal to 0 for coded video sequences conforming to one or more profiles specified \nin Annex J. Decoders conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex J shall ignore (remove from the bitstream \nand discard) NAL units for which nal_unit_type is equal to 14 or 20 and for which svc_extension_flag is equal to 1. \navc_3d_extension_flag  indicates  for  NAL  units  having  nal_unit_type  equal  to  21  whether  a \nnal_unit_header_mvc_extension( ) or nal_unit_header_3davc_extension( ) will follow next in the syntax structure. \nWhen avc_3d_extension_flag is not present, the value of avc_3d_extension_flag is inferred to be equal to 0. \nThe value of DepthFlag is specified as follows. \nDepthFlag = ( nal_unit_type  ! =  21 ) ? 0 : ( avc_3d_extension_flag ? depth_flag : 1 )  (7-2) \nThe value of avc_3d_extension_flag shall be equal to 0 for coded video sequences conforming to one or more profiles \nspecified in Annex I. Decoders conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex I shall ignore (remove from the \nbitstream and discard) NAL units for which nal_unit_type is equal to  21 and for which avc_3d_extension_flag is equal \nto 1. \nrbsp_byte[ i ] is the i-th byte of an RBSP. An RBSP is specified as an ordered sequence of bytes as follows. \nThe RBSP contains an SODB as follows: \n\u2013  If the SODB is empty (i.e., zero bits in length), the RBSP is also empty. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the RBSP contains the SODB as follows: \n \n\n1)  The first byte of the RBSP contains the (most significant, left-most) eight bits of the SODB; the next byte of the \nRBSP contains the next eight bits of the SODB, etc., until fewer than eight bits of the SODB remain. \n2)  rbsp_trailing_bits( ) are present after the SODB as follows: \ni)  The first (most significant, left-most) bits of the final RBSP byte contains the remaining bits of the SODB \n(if any). \nii)  The next bit consists of a single rbsp_stop_one_bit equal to 1. \niii)  When the rbsp_stop_one_bit is not the last bit of a byte-aligned byte, one or more rbsp_alignment_zero_bit \nis present to result in byte alignment. \n3)  One or more cabac_zero_word 16-bit syntax elements equal to 0x0000 may be present in some RBSPs after the \nrbsp_trailing_bits( ) at the end of the RBSP. \nSyntax structures having these RBSP properties are denoted in the syntax tables using an \"_rbsp\" suffix. These structures \nshall be carried within NAL units as the content of the rbsp_byte[ i ] data bytes.

The RBSP data is searched for byte-aligned bits of the following binary patterns: \n  '00000000 00000000 000000xx'  (where xx represents any 2 bit pattern: 00, 01, 10, or 11), \nand a byte equal to 0x03 is inserted to replace these bit patterns with the patterns: \n  '00000000 00000000 00000011 000000xx', \nand finally, when the last byte of the RBSP data is equal to 0x00 (which can only occur when the RBSP ends in \na cabac_zero_word), a final byte equal to 0x03 is appended to the end of the data.

Interpretation  sample  values  should  be  clipped  to  the  range  of  alpha_opaque_value  to \nalpha_transparent_value, inclusive. \nThe decoding of the sequence parameter set extension and the decoding of auxiliary coded pictures is not required for \nconformance with this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThe syntax of each coded slice of an auxiliary coded picture shall obey the same constraints as a coded slice of a redundant \npicture, with the following differences of constraints: \na)  In regard to whether the primary coded picture is an IDR picture, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the primary coded picture is an IDR picture, the auxiliary coded slice syntax shall correspond to that of a \nslice having nal_unit_type equal to 5 (a slice of an IDR picture). \n\u2013  Otherwise (the primary coded picture is not an IDR picture), the auxiliary coded slice syntax shall correspond \nto that of a slice having nal_unit_type equal to 1 (a slice of a non-IDR picture). \nb)  The slices of an auxiliary coded picture (when present) shall contain all macroblocks corresponding to those of \nthe primary coded picture. \nc)  redundant_pic_cnt shall be equal to 0 in all auxiliary coded slices. \nThe (optional) decoding process for the decoding of auxiliary coded pictures is the same as if the auxiliary coded pictures \nwere primary coded pictures in a separate coded video stream that differs from the primary coded pictures in the current \ncoded video stream in the following ways: \n\u2013  The IDR or non-IDR status of each auxiliary coded picture shall be inferred to be the same as the IDR or non-IDR \nstatus of the primary picture in the same access unit, rather than being inferred from the value of nal_unit_type. \n\u2013  The value of chroma_format_idc and the value of ChromaArrayType shall be inferred to be equal to 0 for the decoding \nof the auxiliary coded pictures. \n\u2013  The value of bit_depth_luma_minus8 shall be inferred to be equal to bit_depth_aux_minus8 for the decoding of the \nauxiliary coded pictures. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 Alpha blending composition is normally performed with a background picture B, a foreground picture F, and a decoded \nauxiliary coded picture A, all of the same size. Assume for purposes of example illustration that the chroma resolution of B and F \nhave been upsampled to the same resolution as the luma. Denote corresponding samples of B, F and A by b, f and a, respectively. \nDenote luma and chroma samples by subscripts Y, Cb and Cr. \n \n\nDefine the variables alphaRange, alphaFwt and alphaBwt as follows: \n  alphaRange = Abs( alpha_opaque_value \u2212 alpha_transparent_value ) \n  alphaFwt = Abs( a \u2212 alpha_transparent_value ) \n  alphaBwt = Abs( a \u2212 alpha_opaque_value ) \nThen, in alpha blending composition, samples d of the displayed picture D may be calculated as \n  dY = ( alphaFwt * fY + alphaBwt * bY + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \n  dCb = ( alphaFwt * fCb + alphaBwt * bCb + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \n  dCr = ( alphaFwt * fCr + alphaBwt * bCr + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \nThe samples of pictures D, F and B could also represent red, green, and blue component values (see clause E.2.1). Here we have \nassumed Y, Cb and Cr component values. Each component, e.g., Y, is assumed for purposes of example illustration above to have \nthe same bit depth in each of the pictures D, F and B. However, different components, e.g., Y and Cb, need not have the same bit \ndepth in this example. \nWhen aux_format_idc is equal to 1, F would be the decoded picture obtained from the decoded luma and chroma, and A would be \nthe decoded picture obtained from the decoded auxiliary coded picture. In this case, the indicated example alpha blending \ncomposition involves multiplying the samples of F by factors obtained from the samples of A. \nA picture format that is useful for editing or direct viewing, and that is commonly used, is called pre-multiplied-black video. If the \nforeground picture was F, then the pre-multiplied-black video S is given by \n  sY  = ( alphaFwt * fY ) / alphaRange \n  sCb = ( alphaFwt * fCb ) / alphaRange \n  sCr = ( alphaFwt * fCr ) / alphaRange \nPre-multiplied-black video has the characteristic that the picture S will appear correct if displayed against a black background. For \na non-black background B, the composition of the displayed picture D may be calculated as \n  dY  = sY + ( alphaBwt * bY + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \n  dCb = sCb + ( alphaBwt * bCb + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \n  dCr = sCr + ( alphaBwt * bCr + alphaRange / 2 ) / alphaRange \nWhen aux_format_idc is equal to 2, S would be the decoded picture obtained from the decoded luma and chroma, and A would \nagain be the decoded picture obtained from the decoded auxiliary coded picture. In this case, alpha blending composition does not \ninvolve multiplication of the samples of S by factors obtained from the samples of A. \nadditional_extension_flag equal to 0 indicates that no additional data follows within the sequence parameter set extension \nsyntax structure prior to the RBSP trailing bits. The value of additional_extension_flag shall be equal to 0. The value of 1 \nfor additional_extension_flag is reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC.

marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\"  that  has  a  value  of  frame_num  equal  to  any  value  taken  on  by  the  variable \nUnusedShortTermFrameNum in the following: \nUnusedShortTermFrameNum = ( PrevRefFrameNum + 1 ) % MaxFrameNum \nwhile( UnusedShortTermFrameNum  !=  frame_num )   (7-24) \n  UnusedShortTermFrameNum = ( UnusedShortTermFrameNum + 1 ) % MaxFrameNum \nb)  The value of frame_num is constrained as follows: \n\u2013  If gaps_in_frame_num_value_allowed_flag is equal to 0, the value of frame_num for the current picture \nshall be equal to ( PrevRefFrameNum + 1 ) % MaxFrameNum. \n\u2013  Otherwise (gaps_in_frame_num_value_allowed_flag is equal to 1), the following applies: \n\u2013  If frame_num is greater than PrevRefFrameNum, there shall not be any non-reference pictures in the \nbitstream that follow the previous reference picture and precede the current picture in decoding order \nin which either of the following conditions is true: \n\u2013  The value of frame_num for the non-reference picture is less than PrevRefFrameNum, \n\u2013  The value of frame_num for the non-reference picture is greater than the value of frame_num for \nthe current picture. \n\u2013  Otherwise (frame_num is less than PrevRefFrameNum), there shall not be any non-reference pictures \nin the bitstream that follow the previous reference picture and precede the current picture in decoding \norder in which both of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  The value of frame_num for the non-reference picture is less than PrevRefFrameNum, \n\u2013  The value of frame_num for the non-reference picture is greater than the value of frame_num for \nthe current picture. \nA picture including a memory_management_control_operation equal to 5 shall have frame_num constraints as described \nabove and, after the decoding of the current picture and the processing of the memory management control operations, the \npicture shall be inferred to have had frame_num equal to 0 for all subsequent use in the decoding process, except as \nspecified in clause 7.4.1.2.4. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 When the primary coded picture is not an IDR picture and does not contain memory_management_control_operation \nsyntax element equal to 5, the value of frame_num of a corresponding redundant coded picture is the same as the value of frame_num \n \n\nin the primary coded picture. Alternatively, the redundant coded picture includes a memory_management_control_operation syntax \nelement equal to 5 and the corresponding primary coded picture is an IDR picture. \nfield_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that the slice is a slice of a coded field. field_pic_flag equal to 0 specifies that the slice \nis a slice of a coded frame. When field_pic_flag is not present it shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nThe variable MbaffFrameFlag is derived as \nMbaffFrameFlag = ( mb_adaptive_frame_field_flag  &&  !field_pic_flag )  (7-25) \nThe variable for the picture height in units of macroblocks is derived as \nPicHeightInMbs = FrameHeightInMbs / ( 1 + field_pic_flag )  (7-26) \nThe variable for picture height for the luma component is derived as \nPicHeightInSamples  = PicHeightInMbs * 16    (7-27) \nL\nThe variable for picture height for the chroma component is derived as \nPicHeightInSamples  = PicHeightInMbs * MbHeightC  (7-28) \nC\nThe variable PicSizeInMbs for the current picture is derived as \nPicSizeInMbs = PicWidthInMbs * PicHeightInMbs    (7-29) \nThe variable MaxPicNum is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 0, MaxPicNum is set equal to MaxFrameNum. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 1), MaxPicNum is set equal to 2*MaxFrameNum. \nThe variable CurrPicNum is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 0, CurrPicNum is set equal to frame_num. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 1), CurrPicNum is set equal to 2 * frame_num + 1. \nbottom_field_flag equal to 1 specifies that the slice is part of a coded bottom field. bottom_field_flag equal to 0 specifies \nthat the picture is a coded top field. When this syntax element is not present for the current slice, it shall be inferred to be \nequal to 0. \nidr_pic_id identifies an IDR picture. The values of idr_pic_id in all the slices of an IDR picture shall remain unchanged. \nWhen two consecutive access units in decoding order are both IDR access units, the value of idr_pic_id in the slices of the \nfirst such IDR access unit shall differ from the idr_pic_id in the second such IDR access unit. The value of idr_pic_id shall \nbe in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 It is not prohibited for multiple IDR pictures in a bitstream to have the same value of idr_pic_id unless such pictures \noccur in two consecutive access units in decoding order. \npic_order_cnt_lsb specifies the picture order count modulo MaxPicOrderCntLsb for the top field of a coded frame or for \na coded field. The length of the pic_order_cnt_lsb syntax element is log2_max_pic_order_cnt_lsb_minus4 + 4 bits. The \nvalue of the pic_order_cnt_lsb shall be in the range of 0 to MaxPicOrderCntLsb \u2212 1, inclusive. \ndelta_pic_order_cnt_bottom specifies the picture order count difference between the bottom field and the top field of a \ncoded frame as follows: \n\u2013  If  the  current  picture  includes  a  memory_management_control_operation  equal  to  5,  the  value  of \ndelta_pic_order_cnt_bottom shall be in the range of ( 1 \u2212 MaxPicOrderCntLsb ) to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture does not include a memory_management_control_operation equal to 5), the value of \ndelta_pic_order_cnt_bottom shall be in the range of \u2212231 + 1 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. \nWhen this syntax element is not present in the bitstream for the current slice, it shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \ndelta_pic_order_cnt[ 0 ] specifies the picture order count difference from the expected picture order count for the top \nfield of a coded frame or for a coded field as specified in clause 8.2.1. The value of delta_pic_order_cnt[ 0 ] shall be in the \nrange of \u2212231 + 1 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. When this syntax element is not present in the bitstream for the current slice, it shall \nbe inferred to be equal to 0. \ndelta_pic_order_cnt[ 1 ] specifies the picture order count difference from the expected picture order count for the bottom \nfield of a coded frame specified in clause 8.2.1. The value of delta_pic_order_cnt[ 1 ] shall be in the range of \u2212231 + 1 \n \n\nto 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. When this syntax element is not present in the bitstream for the current slice, it shall be inferred to be \nequal to 0. \nredundant_pic_cnt shall be equal to 0 for slices and slice data partitions belonging to the primary coded picture. The \nvalue of redundant_pic_cnt shall be greater than 0 for coded slices or coded slice data partitions of a redundant coded \npicture. When redundant_pic_cnt is not present in the bitstream, its value shall be inferred to be equal to 0. The value of \nredundant_pic_cnt shall be in the range of 0 to 127, inclusive. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 Any area of the decoded primary picture and the corresponding area that would result from application of the decoding \nprocess specified in clause 8 for any redundant picture in the same access unit should be visually similar in appearance. \nThe value of pic_parameter_set_id in a coded slice or coded slice data partition of a redundant coded picture shall be such \nthat the value of bottom_field_pic_order_in_frame_present_flag in the picture parameter set in use in a redundant coded \npicture is equal to the value of bottom_field_pic_order_in_frame_present_flag in the picture parameter set in use in the \ncorresponding primary coded picture. \nWhen present in the primary coded picture and any redundant coded picture, the following syntax elements shall have the \nsame value: field_pic_flag, bottom_field_flag, and idr_pic_id. \nWhen the value of nal_ref_idc in one VCL NAL unit of an access unit is equal to 0, the value of nal_ref_idc in all other \nVCL NAL units of the same access unit shall be equal to 0. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 The above constraint also has the following implications. If the value of nal_ref_idc for the VCL NAL units of the primary \ncoded picture is equal to 0, the value of nal_ref_idc for the VCL NAL units of any corresponding redundant coded picture are equal \nto 0; otherwise (the value of nal_ref_idc for the VCL NAL units of the primary coded picture is greater than 0), the value of \nnal_ref_idc for the VCL NAL units of any corresponding redundant coded picture are also greater than 0. \nThe marking status of reference pictures and the value of frame_num after the decoded reference picture marking process \nas specified in clause 8.2.5 is invoked for the primary coded picture or any redundant coded picture of the same access unit \nshall be identical regardless whether the primary coded picture or any redundant coded picture (instead of the primary \ncoded picture) of the access unit would be decoded. \nNOTE 8 \u2013 The above constraint also has the following implications. \nWhen the primary coded picture is an IDR picture and a redundant coded picture corresponding to the primary coded picture is an \nIDR picture, the contents of the dec_ref_pic_marking( ) syntax structure must be identical in all slice headers of the primary coded \npicture and the redundant coded picture corresponding to the primary coded picture. \nWhen the primary coded picture is an IDR picture and a redundant coded picture corresponding to the primary coded picture is not \nan IDR picture, all slice headers of the redundant picture must contain a dec_ref_pic_marking syntax( ) structure including a \nmemory_management_control_operation syntax element equal to 5, and the following applies: \n\u2013  If the value of long_term_reference_flag in the primary coded picture is equal to 0, the dec_ref_pic_marking syntax structure \nof the redundant coded picture must not include a memory_management_control_operation syntax element equal to 6. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the value of long_term_reference_flag in the primary coded picture is equal to 1), the dec_ref_pic_marking syntax \nstructure of the redundant coded picture must include memory_management_control_operation syntax elements equal to 5, 4, \nand  6  in  decoding  order,  and  the  value  of  max_long_term_frame_idx_plus1  must  be  equal  to 1,  and  the  value  of \nlong_term_frame_idx must be equal to 0. \nThe values of TopFieldOrderCnt and BottomFieldOrderCnt (if applicable) that result after completion of the decoding \nprocess for any redundant coded picture or the primary coded picture of the same access unit shall be identical regardless \nwhether the primary coded picture or any redundant coded picture (instead of the primary coded picture) of the access unit \nwould be decoded. \nThere is no required decoding process for a coded slice or coded slice data partition of a redundant coded picture. When \nthe redundant_pic_cnt in the slice header of a coded slice is greater than 0, the decoder may discard the coded slice. \nHowever, a coded slice or coded slice data partition of any redundant coded picture shall obey the same constraints as a \ncoded slice or coded slice data partition of a primary picture. \nNOTE 9 \u2013 When some of the samples in the decoded primary picture cannot be correctly decoded due to errors or losses in \ntransmission of the sequence and one or more coded slices of a redundant coded picture can be correctly decoded, the decoder should \nreplace the samples of the decoded primary picture with the corresponding samples of the decoded slice or decoded slices of the \nredundant coded picture. When slices of more than one redundant coded picture cover the relevant region of the primary coded \npicture, the slice or slices of the redundant coded picture having the lowest value of redundant_pic_cnt should be used. \nSlices and slice data partitions having the same value of redundant_pic_cnt belong to the same coded picture. If the value \nof redundant_pic_cnt is equal to 0, they belong to the primary coded picture; otherwise (the value of redundant_pic_cnt is \ngreater than 0), they belong to the same redundant coded picture. Decoded slices within the same redundant coded picture \nneed not cover the entire picture area and shall not overlap. \ndirect_spatial_mv_pred_flag specifies the method used in the decoding process to derive motion vectors and reference \nindices for inter prediction as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  If  direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag  is  equal  to 1,  the  derivation  process  for  luma  motion  vectors  for  B_Skip, \nB_Direct_16x16, and B_Direct_8x8 in  clause 8.4.1.2 shall use spatial direct mode prediction as specified in \nclause 8.4.1.2.2. \n\u2013  Otherwise (direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag is equal to 0), the derivation process for luma motion vectors for B_Skip, \nB_Direct_16x16, and B_Direct_8x8 in clause 8.4.1.2 shall use temporal direct mode prediction as specified in \nclause 8.4.1.2.3. \nnum_ref_idx_active_override_flag equal to 1 specifies that the syntax element num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 is present \nfor  P,  SP,  and  B  slices  and  that  the  syntax  element  num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1  is  present  for  B  slices. \nnum_ref_idx_active_override_flag equal to 0 specifies that the syntax elements num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 and \nnum_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 are not present. \nWhen  the  current  slice  is  a  P,  SP,  or  B  slice  and  field_pic_flag  is  equal  to 0  and  the  value  of \nnum_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1 in the picture parameter set exceeds 15, num_ref_idx_active_override_flag shall \nbe equal to 1. \nWhen the current slice is a B slice and field_pic_flag is equal to 0 and the value of num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1 \nin the picture parameter set exceeds 15, num_ref_idx_active_override_flag shall be equal to 1. \nnum_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 specifies the maximum reference index for reference picture list 0 that shall be used to \ndecode the slice. \nWhen  the  current  slice  is  a  P,  SP,  or  B  slice  and  num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1  is  not  present, \nnum_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 shall be inferred to be equal to num_ref_idx_l0_default_active_minus1. \nThe range of num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 0, num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 15, inclusive. When \nMbaffFrameFlag is equal to 1, num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 is the maximum index value for the decoding of frame \nmacroblocks and 2 * num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 + 1 is the maximum index value for the decoding of field \nmacroblocks. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 1), num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 31, inclusive. \nnum_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 specifies the maximum reference index for reference picture list 1 that shall be used to \ndecode the slice. \nWhen the current slice is a B slice and num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 is not present, num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 shall \nbe inferred to be equal to num_ref_idx_l1_default_active_minus1. \nThe  range  of  num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1  is  constrained  as  specified  in  the  semantics  for \nnum_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 with l0 and list 0 replaced by l1 and list 1, respectively. \ncabac_init_idc specifies the index for determining the initialization table used in the initialization process for context \nvariables. The value of cabac_init_idc shall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. \nslice_qp_delta specifies the initial value of QP  to be used for all the macroblocks in the slice until modified by the value \nY\nof mb_qp_delta in the macroblock layer. The initial QP  quantization parameter for the slice is computed as \nY\nSliceQP  = 26 + pic_init_qp_minus26 + slice_qp_delta  (7-30) \nY\nThe value of slice_qp_delta shall be limited such that SliceQP  is in the range of \u2212QpBdOffset  to +51, inclusive. \nY Y\nsp_for_switch_flag specifies the decoding process to be used to decode P macroblocks in an SP slice as follows: \n\u2013  If sp_for_switch_flag is equal to 0, the P macroblocks in the SP slice shall be decoded using the SP decoding process \nfor non-switching pictures as specified in clause 8.6.1. \n\u2013  Otherwise (sp_for_switch_flag is equal to 1), the P macroblocks in the SP slice shall be decoded using the SP and SI \ndecoding process for switching pictures as specified in clause 8.6.2. \nslice_qs_delta specifies the value of QS  for all the macroblocks in SP and SI slices. The QS  quantization parameter for \nY Y\nthe slice is computed as \nQS  = 26 + pic_init_qs_minus26 + slice_qs_delta    (7-31) \nY\nThe value of slice_qs_delta shall be limited such that QS  is in the range of 0 to 51, inclusive. This value of QS  is used \nY Y\nfor the decoding of all macroblocks in SI slices with mb_type equal to SI and all macroblocks in SP slices that are coded \nin an Inter macroblock prediction mode. \n \n\ndisable_deblocking_filter_idc specifies whether the operation of the deblocking filter shall be disabled across some block \nedges of the slice and specifies for which edges the filtering is disabled. When disable_deblocking_filter_idc is not present \nin the slice header, the value of disable_deblocking_filter_idc shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nThe value of disable_deblocking_filter_idc shall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. \nslice_alpha_c0_offset_div2 specifies the offset used in accessing the \u03b1 and t  deblocking filter tables for filtering \nC0\noperations controlled by the macroblocks within the slice. From this value, the offset that shall be applied when addressing \nthese tables shall be computed as \nFilterOffsetA = slice_alpha_c0_offset_div2 << 1    (7-32) \nThe value of slice_alpha_c0_offset_div2 shall be in the range of \u22126 to +6, inclusive. When slice_alpha_c0_offset_div2 is \nnot present in the slice header, the value of slice_alpha_c0_offset_div2 shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nslice_beta_offset_div2 specifies the offset used in accessing the \u03b2 deblocking filter table for filtering operations controlled \nby the macroblocks within the slice. From this value, the offset that is applied when addressing the \u03b2 table of the deblocking \nfilter shall be computed as \nFilterOffsetB = slice_beta_offset_div2 << 1    (7-33) \nThe value of slice_beta_offset_div2 shall be in the range of \u22126 to +6, inclusive. When slice_beta_offset_div2 is not present \nin the slice header the value of slice_beta_offset_div2 shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nslice_group_change_cycle  is  used  to  derive  the  number  of  slice  group  map  units  in  slice  group  0  when \nslice_group_map_type is equal to 3, 4, or 5, as specified by \nMapUnitsInSliceGroup0 = Min( slice_group_change_cycle * SliceGroupChangeRate, \n                                                     PicSizeInMapUnits )   (7-34) \nThe value of slice_group_change_cycle is represented in the bitstream by the following number of bits \nCeil( Log2( PicSizeInMapUnits \u00f7 SliceGroupChangeRate + 1 ) )  (7-35) \nThe value of slice_group_change_cycle shall be in the range of 0 to Ceil( PicSizeInMapUnits\u00f7SliceGroupChangeRate ), \ninclusive. \n",

            "section_text": "7.4.3.3  Decoded reference picture marking semantics \n\nThe syntax elements no_output_of_prior_pics_flag, long_term_reference_flag, adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag, \nmemory_management_control_operation, difference_of_pic_nums_minus1, long_term_frame_idx, long_term_pic_num, \nand max_long_term_frame_idx_plus1 specify marking of the reference pictures. \nThe marking of a reference picture can be \"unused for reference\", \"used for short-term reference\", or \"used for long-term \nreference\", but only one among these three. When a reference picture is referred to as being marked as \"used for reference\", \nthis collectively refers to the picture being marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \"used for long-term reference\" \n(but not both). A reference picture that is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" is referred to as a short-term reference \npicture. A reference picture that is marked as \"used for long-term reference\" is referred to as a long-term reference picture. \nThe content of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure shall be the same in all slice headers of the primary \ncoded picture. When one or more redundant coded pictures are present, the content of the decoded reference picture \nmarking syntax structure shall be the same in all slice headers of a redundant coded picture with a particular value of \nredundant_pic_cnt. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 It is not required that the content of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure in a redundant coded picture \nwith a particular value of redundant_pic_cnt is identical to the content of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure in \nthe corresponding primary coded picture or a redundant coded picture with a different value of redundant_pic_cnt. However, as \nspecified in clause 7.4.3, the content of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure in a redundant coded picture is \nconstrained in the way that the marking status of reference pictures and the value of frame_num after the decoded reference picture \nmarking process in clause 8.2.5 must be identical regardless whether the primary coded picture or any redundant coded picture of \nthe access unit would be decoded. \nThe syntax category of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure shall be inferred as follows: \n\u2013  If the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure is in a slice header, the syntax category of the decoded \nreference picture marking syntax structure is inferred to be equal to 2. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure is in a decoded reference picture marking repetition \nSEI message as specified in Annex D), the syntax category of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure \nis inferred to be equal to 5. \nno_output_of_prior_pics_flag specifies how the previously-decoded pictures in the decoded picture buffer are treated \nafter decoding of an IDR picture. See Annex C. When the IDR picture is the first IDR picture in the bitstream, the value \nof no_output_of_prior_pics_flag has no effect on the decoding process. When the IDR picture is not the first IDR picture \nin the bitstream and the value of PicWidthInMbs, FrameHeightInMbs, or max_dec_frame_buffering derived from the \nactive  sequence  parameter  set  is  different  from  the  value  of  PicWidthInMbs,  FrameHeightInMbs,  or \nmax_dec_frame_buffering  derived  from  the  sequence  parameter  set  active  for  the  preceding  picture, \nno_output_of_prior_pics_flag equal to 1 may (but should not) be inferred by the decoder, regardless of the actual value of \nno_output_of_prior_pics_flag. \nlong_term_reference_flag equal to 0 specifies that the MaxLongTermFrameIdx variable is set equal to \"no long-term \nframe indices\" and that the IDR picture is marked as \"used for short-term reference\". long_term_reference_flag equal to 1 \nspecifies that the MaxLongTermFrameIdx variable is set equal to 0 and that the current IDR picture is marked \"used for \nlong-term  reference\"  and  is  assigned  LongTermFrameIdx  equal  to 0.  When  max_num_ref_frames  is  equal  to 0, \nlong_term_reference_flag shall be equal to 0. \nadaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag selects the reference picture marking mode of the currently decoded picture as \nspecified  in  Table 7-8.  adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag  shall  be  equal  to  1  when  the  number  of  frames, \ncomplementary field pairs, and non-paired fields that are currently marked as \"used for long-term reference\" is equal to \nMax( max_num_ref_frames, 1 ). \nTable 7-8 \u2013 Interpretation of adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag \nadaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag  Reference picture marking mode specified \n0  Sliding window reference picture marking mode: A marking mode \nproviding  a  first-in  first-out  mechanism  for  short-term  reference \npictures. \n1  Adaptive  reference  picture  marking  mode:  A  reference  picture \nmarking  mode providing syntax elements to specify marking of \nreference pictures as \"unused for reference\" and to assign long-term \nframe indices. \n \n \n\nmemory_management_control_operation specifies a control operation to be applied to affect the reference picture \nmarking. The memory_management_control_operation syntax element is followed by data necessary for the operation \nspecified by the value of memory_management_control_operation. The values and control operations associated with \nmemory_management_control_operation are specified in Table 7-9. The memory_management_control_operation syntax \nelements are processed by the decoding process in the order in which they appear in the slice header, and the semantics \nconstraints expressed for each memory_management_control_operation apply at the specific position in that order at which \nthat individual memory_management_control_operation is processed. \nFor interpretation of memory_management_control_operation, the term reference picture is interpreted as follows: \n\u2013  If the current picture is a frame, the term reference picture refers either to a reference frame or a complementary \nreference field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture is a field), the term reference picture refers either to a reference field or a field of a \nreference frame. \nmemory_management_control_operation shall not be equal to 1 in a slice header unless the specified reference picture is \nmarked as \"used for short-term reference\" when the memory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding \nprocess. \nmemory_management_control_operation shall not be equal to 2 in a slice header unless the specified long-term picture \nnumber  refers  to  a  reference  picture  that  is  marked  as  \"used  for  long-term  reference\"  when  the \nmemory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding process. \nmemory_management_control_operation shall not be equal to 3 in a slice header unless the specified reference picture is \nmarked as \"used for short-term reference\" when the memory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding \nprocess. \nmemory_management_control_operation shall not be equal to 3 or 6 if the value of the variable MaxLongTermFrameIdx \nis equal to \"no long-term frame indices\" when the memory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding \nprocess. \nNot more than one memory_management_control_operation equal to 4 shall be present in a slice header. \nNot more than one memory_management_control_operation equal to 5 shall be present in a slice header. \nNot more than one memory_management_control_operation equal to 6 shall be present in a slice header. \nmemory_management_control_operation  shall  not  be  equal  to  5  in  a  slice  header  unless  no \nmemory_management_control_operation in the range of 1 to 3 is present in the same decoded reference picture marking \nsyntax structure. \nA memory_management_control_operation equal to 5 shall not follow a memory_management_control_operation equal \nto 6 in the same slice header. \nWhen a memory_management_control_operation equal to 6 is present, any memory_management_control_operation \nequal to 2, 3, or 4 that follows the memory_management_control_operation equal to 6 within the same slice header shall \nnot specify the current picture to be marked as \"unused for reference\". \nNOTE 2 \u2013 These constraints prohibit any combination of multiple memory_management_control_operation syntax elements that \nwould  specify  the  current  picture  to  be  marked  as  \"unused  for  reference\".  However,  some  other  combinations  of \nmemory_management_control_operation syntax elements are permitted that may affect the marking status of other reference \npictures more than once in the same slice header. In particular, it is permitted for a memory_management_control_operation equal \nto 3 that specifies a long-term frame index to be assigned to a particular short-term reference picture to be followed in the same slice \nheader by a memory_management_control_operation equal to 2, 3, 4 or 6 that specifies the same reference picture to subsequently \nbe marked as \"unused for reference\". \n

field and a memory_management_control_operation command equal to 3 is present that assigns a long-\nterm frame index to a field that is part of a short-term reference frame or part of a complementary reference field pair, \nanother memory_management_control_operation command (equal to 3 or 6) to assign the same long-term frame index to \nthe other field of the same frame or complementary reference field pair shall be present in the same decoded reference \npicture marking syntax structure. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 The above requirement must be fulfilled even when the field referred to by the memory_management_control_operation \nequal to 3 is subsequently marked as \"unused for reference\" (for example when a memory_management_control_operation equal \nto 2 is present in the same slice header that causes the field to be marked as \"unused for reference\"). \nNOTE 4 \u2013 The above requirement has the following implications: \n\u2013  When a memory_management_control_operation equal to 3 is present that assigns a long-term frame index to a field that is part \nof a reference frame or complementary reference field pair with both fields marked as \"used for short-term reference\" (when \nprocessing the memory_management_control_operation equal to 3), another memory_management_control_operation equal \nto 3 must also be present in the same decoded reference picture marking syntax structure that assigns the same long-term frame \nindex to the other field of the reference frame or complementary reference field pair. \n\u2013  When  the  current  picture  is  the  second  field  (in  decoding  order)  of  a  complementary  reference  field  pair  and  a \nmemory_management_control_operation equal to 3 is present in the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure of the \ncurrent picture that assigns a long-term frame index to the first field (in decoding order) of the complementary reference field \npair, a memory_management_control_operation equal to 6 must be present in the same decoded reference picture marking \nsyntax structure that assigns the same long-term frame index to the second field of the complementary reference field pair. \nWhen the first field (in decoding order) of a complementary reference field pair included a long_term_reference_flag equal \nto 1 or a memory_management_control_operation command equal to 6, the decoded reference picture marking syntax \nstructure  for  the  second  field  of  the  complementary  reference  field  pair  shall  contain  a \nmemory_management_control_operation command equal to 6 that assigns the same long-term frame index to the second \nfield. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 The above requirement must be fulfilled even when the first field of the complementary reference field pair is \nsubsequently marked as \"unused for reference\" (for example, when a memory_management_control_operation equal to 2 is present \nin the slice header of the second field that causes the first field to be marked as \"unused for reference\"). \nWhen  the  second  field  (in  decoding  order)  of  a  complementary  reference  field  pair  includes  a \nmemory_management_control_operation command equal to 6 that assigns a long-term frame index to this field and the \nfirst  field  of  the  complementary  reference  field  pair  is  marked  as  \"used  for  short-term  reference\"  when  the \nmemory_management_control_operation command equal to 6 is processed by the decoding process, the decoded reference \npicture marking syntax structure of that second field shall contain either a memory_management_control_operation \ncommand  equal  to 1  that  marks  the  first  field  of  the  complementary  field  pair  as  \"unused  for  reference\"  or  a \nmemory_management_control_operation command equal to 3 that marks the first field of the complementary field pair as \n\"used for long-term reference\" and assigns the same long-term frame index to the first field. \n \n\nNOTE 6 \u2013 The above constraints specify that when both fields of a frame or a complementary field pair are marked as \"used for \nreference\" after processing all memory_management_control_operation commands of the decoded reference picture marking syntax \nstructure, either both fields must be marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or both fields must be marked as \"used for long-term \nreference\". When both fields are marked as \"used for long-term reference\", the same long-term frame index must be assigned to \nboth fields. \ndifference_of_pic_nums_minus1 is used (with memory_management_control_operation equal to 3 or 1) to assign a long-\nterm frame index to a short-term reference picture or to mark a short-term reference picture as \"unused for reference\". \nWhen the associated memory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding process, the resulting picture \nnumber derived from difference_of_pic_nums_minus1 shall be a picture number assigned to one of the reference pictures \nmarked as \"used for reference\" and not previously assigned to a long-term frame index. \nThe resulting picture number is constrained as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the resulting picture number shall be one of the set of picture numbers assigned to \nreference frames or complementary reference field pairs. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 When field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the resulting picture number must be a picture number assigned to a \ncomplementary reference field pair in which both fields are marked as \"used for reference\" or a frame in which both \nfields are marked as \"used for reference\". In particular, when field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the marking of a non-paired \nfield  or  a  frame  in  which  a  single  field  is  marked  as  \"used  for  reference\"  cannot  be  affected  by  a \nmemory_management_control_operation equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 1), the resulting picture number shall be one of the set of picture numbers \nassigned to reference fields. \nlong_term_pic_num is used (with memory_management_control_operation equal to 2) to mark a long-term reference \npicture as \"unused for reference\". When the associated memory_management_control_operation is processed by the \ndecoding process, long_term_pic_num shall be equal to a long-term picture number assigned to one of the reference \npictures that is currently marked as \"used for long-term reference\". \nThe resulting long-term picture number is constrained as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the resulting long-term picture number shall be one of the set of long-term picture \nnumbers assigned to reference frames or complementary reference field pairs. \nNOTE 8 \u2013 When field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the resulting long-term picture number must be a long-term picture number \nassigned to a complementary reference field pair in which both fields are marked as \"used for reference\" or a frame in \nwhich both fields are marked as \"used for reference\". In particular, when field_pic_flag is equal to 0, the marking of a \nnon-paired field or a frame in which a single field is marked as \"used for reference\" cannot be affected by a \nmemory_management_control_operation equal to 2. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 1), the resulting long-term picture number shall be one of the set of long-term \npicture numbers assigned to reference fields. \nlong_term_frame_idx is used (with memory_management_control_operation equal to 3 or 6) to assign a long-term frame \nindex to a picture. When the associated memory_management_control_operation is processed by the decoding process, \nthe value of long_term_frame_idx shall be in the range of 0 to MaxLongTermFrameIdx, inclusive. \nmax_long_term_frame_idx_plus1 minus 1 specifies the maximum value of long-term frame index allowed for long-term \nreference  pictures  (until  receipt  of  another  value  of  max_long_term_frame_idx_plus1).  The  value  of \nmax_long_term_frame_idx_plus1 shall be in the range of 0 to max_num_ref_frames, inclusive. \n",

(only \nneeded to be invoked for one slice of a picture) \n\u2013  The method of combining the various slice data partitions when slice data partitioning is used is described \nin clause 8.2.3. \n \n\n\u2013  When the frame_num of the current picture is not equal to PrevRefFrameNum and is not equal to \n( PrevRefFrameNum + 1 ) % MaxFrameNum, the decoding process for gaps in frame_num is performed \naccording to clause 8.2.5.2 prior to the decoding of any slices of the current picture. \n\u2013  At the beginning of the decoding process for each P, SP, or B slice, the decoding process for reference \npicture lists construction specified in clause 8.2.4 is invoked for derivation of reference picture list 0 \n(RefPicList0), and when decoding a B slice, reference picture list 1 (RefPicList1). \n\u2013  When the current picture is a reference picture and after all slices of the current picture have been decoded, \nthe decoded reference picture marking process in clause 8.2.5 specifies how the current picture is used in \nthe decoding process of inter prediction in later decoded pictures. \n3.  The processes in clauses 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, and 8.7 specify decoding processes using syntax elements in the \nmacroblock layer and above. \n\u2013  The intra prediction process for I and SI macroblocks, except for I_PCM macroblocks as specified in \nclause 8.3, has intra prediction samples as its output. For I_PCM macroblocks clause 8.3 directly specifies \na picture construction process. The output are constructed samples prior to the deblocking filter process. \n\u2013  The inter prediction process for P and B macroblocks is specified in clause 8.4 with inter prediction samples \nbeing the output. \n\u2013  The transform coefficient decoding process and picture construction process prior to deblocking filter \nprocess are specified in clause 8.5. That process derives samples for I and B macroblocks and for P \nmacroblocks in P slices. The output are constructed samples prior to the deblocking filter process. \n\u2013  The decoding process for P macroblocks in SP slices or SI macroblocks is specified in clause 8.6. That \nprocess derives samples for P macroblocks in SP slices and for SI macroblocks. The output are constructed \nsamples prior to the deblocking filter process. \n\u2013  The constructed samples prior to the deblocking filter process that are next to the edges of blocks and \nmacroblocks are processed by a deblocking filter as specified in clause 8.7 with the output being the \ndecoded samples. \n",

Figure 8-10 shows edges of a macroblock which can be interpreted as luma or \nchroma edges. \nWhen interpreting the edges in Figure 8-10 as luma edges, depending on the transform_size_8x8_flag, the following \napplies: \n\u2013  If transform_size_8x8_flag is equal to 0, both types, the solid bold and dashed bold luma edges are filtered. \n\u2013  Otherwise (transform_size_8x8_flag is equal to 1), only the solid bold luma edges are filtered. \nWhen interpreting the edges in Figure 8-10 as chroma edges, depending on ChromaArrayType, the following applies: \n\u2013  If ChromaArrayType is equal to 1 (4:2:0 format), only the solid bold chroma edges are filtered. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if ChromaArrayType is equal to 2 (4:2:2 format), the solid bold vertical chroma edges are filtered and \nboth types, the solid bold and dashed bold horizontal chroma edges are filtered. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if ChromaArrayType is equal to 3 (4:4:4 format), the following applies: \n\u2013  If transform_size_8x8_flag is equal to 0, both types, the solid bold and dashed bold chroma edges are filtered. \n\u2013  Otherwise (transform_size_8x8_flag is equal to 1), only the solid bold chroma edges are filtered. \n\u2013  Otherwise (ChromaArrayType is equal to 0), no chroma edges are filtered. \n \n\ns\ne\ng\nd\ne\n la\ntn\no\nz\nir\no\nH\nH.264(09)_F8-10\nVertical edges  \nFigure 8-10 \u2013 Boundaries in a macroblock to be filtered \nFor the current macroblock address CurrMbAddr proceeding over values 0..PicSizeInMbs \u2212 1, the following ordered steps \nare specified: \n1.

Other binarizations are specified in clauses 9.3.2.5 to 9.3.2.7. \nExcept for I slices, the binarizations for the syntax element mb_type as specified in clause 9.3.2.5 consist of bin strings \ngiven by a concatenation of prefix and suffix bit strings. The UEGk binarization as specified in clause 9.3.2.3, which is \nused for the binarization of the syntax elements mvd_lX (X = 0, 1) and coeff_abs_level_minus1, and the binarization of \nthe coded_block_pattern also consist of a concatenation of prefix and suffix bit strings. For these binarization processes, \nthe prefix and the suffix bit string are separately indexed using the binIdx variable as specified further in clause 9.3.3. The \ntwo sets of prefix bit strings and suffix bit strings are referred to as the binarization prefix part and the binarization suffix \npart, respectively. \nAssociated with each binarization or binarization part of a syntax element is a specific value of the context index offset \n(ctxIdxOffset) variable and a specific value of the maxBinIdxCtx variable as given in Table 9-34. When two values for \neach of these variables are specified for one syntax element in Table 9-34, the value in the upper row is related to the prefix \npart while the value in the lower row is related to the suffix part of the binarization of the corresponding syntax element. \nThe use of the DecodeBypass process and the variable bypassFlag is derived as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  If no value is assigned to ctxIdxOffset for the corresponding binarization or binarization part in Table 9-34 labelled \nas \"na\", all bins of the bit strings of the corresponding binarization or of the binarization prefix/suffix part are decoded \nby invoking the DecodeBypass process as specified in clause 9.3.3.2.3.

The value assigned to ctxIdxOffset \nspecifies the lower value of the range of ctxIdx assigned to the corresponding binarization or binarization part of a syntax \nelement. \nctxIdx = ctxIdxOffset = 276 is assigned to the syntax element end_of_slice_flag and the bin of mb_type, which specifies \nthe I_PCM macroblock type as further specified in clause 9.3.3.1.

Given a probability estimation p( 0 ) and \np( 1 ) = 1 \uf02d p( 0 ) of a binary decision ( 0, 1 ), an initially given code sub-interval with the range codIRange will be subdivided into \ntwo sub-intervals having range p( 0 ) * codIRange and codIRange \uf02d p( 0 ) * codIRange, respectively. Depending on the decision, \nwhich has been observed, the corresponding sub-interval will be chosen as the new code interval, and a binary code string pointing \ninto that interval will represent the sequence of observed binary decisions. It is useful to distinguish between the most probable \nsymbol (MPS) and the least probable symbol (LPS), so that binary decisions have to be identified as either MPS or LPS, rather than \n0 or 1. Given this terminology, each context is specified by the probability pLPS of the LPS and the value of MPS (valMPS), which \nis either 0 or 1. \nThe arithmetic core engine in this Recommendation | International Standard has three distinct properties: \n\u2013  The probability estimation is performed by means of a finite-state machine with a table-based transition process between 64 \ndifferent  representative  probability  states  { pLPS(pStateIdx) | 0 <= pStateIdx < 64 }  for  the  LPS  probability  pLPS.  The \nnumbering of the states is arranged in such a way that the probability state with index pStateIdx = 0 corresponds to an LPS \nprobability value of 0.5, with decreasing LPS probability towards higher state indices. \n\u2013  The range codIRange representing the state of the coding engine is quantized to a small set {Q1,\u2026,Q4} of pre-set quantization \nvalues prior to the calculation of the new interval range. Storing a table containing all 64x4 pre-computed product values of \nQi * pLPS(pStateIdx) allows a multiplication-free approximation of the product codIRange * pLPS(pStateIdx). \n\u2013  For syntax elements or parts thereof for which an approximately uniform probability distribution is assumed to be given a \nseparate simplified encoding and decoding bypass process is used. \n",

After initializing for the first slice \nof a coded picture as specified in clause 9.3.4.1, BinCountsInNALunits is incremented as specified in clauses 9.3.4.2, 9.3.4.4, and \n9.3.4.5. \nOutputs of this process are zero or more bytes appended to the NAL unit. \nLet the variable k be set equal to Ceil( ( Ceil( 3 * ( 32 * BinCountsInNALunits \u2212 RawMbBits * PicSizeInMbs ) \u00f7 1024 ) \u2212 \nNumBytesInVclNALunits ) \u00f7 3 ). Depending on the variable k the following applies: \n\u2013  If k is less than or equal to 0, no cabac_zero_word is appended to the NAL unit. \n\u2013  Otherwise (k is greater than 0), the 3-byte sequence 0x000003 is appended k times to the NAL unit after encapsulation, \nwhere  the  first  two  bytes  0x0000  represent  a  cabac_zero_word  and  the  third  byte  0x03  represents  an \nemulation_prevention_three_byte. \n \n\nAnnex A \n \nProfiles and levels \n \n(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.) \nProfiles and levels specify restrictions on bitstreams and hence limits on the capabilities needed to decode the bitstreams. \nProfiles and levels may also be used to indicate interoperability points between individual decoder implementations. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 This Recommendation | International Standard does not include individually selectable \"options\" at the decoder, as this \nwould increase interoperability difficulties. \nEach profile specifies a subset of algorithmic features and limits that shall be supported by all decoders conforming to that \nprofile. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 Encoders are not required to make use of any particular subset of features supported in a profile. \nEach  level  specifies  a  set  of  limits  on  the  values  that  may  be  taken  by  the  syntax  elements  of  this \nRecommendation | International Standard. The same set of level definitions is used with all profiles, but individual \nimplementations may support a different level for each supported profile. For any given profile, levels generally correspond \nto decoder processing load and memory capability. \nThe profiles that are specified in clause A.2 are also referred to as the profiles specified in Annex A. \nA.1  Requirements on video decoder capability \nCapabilities of video decoders conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard are specified in terms of the \nability to decode video streams conforming to the constraints of profiles and levels specified in this annex. For each such \nprofile, the level supported for that profile shall also be expressed. \nSpecific values are specified in this annex for the syntax elements profile_idc and level_idc. All other values of profile_idc \nand level_idc are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. \nNOTE \u2013 Decoders should not infer that when a reserved value of profile_idc or level_idc falls between the values specified in this \nRecommendation | International Standard that this indicates intermediate capabilities between the specified profiles or levels, as \nthere are no restrictions on the method to be chosen by ITU-T | ISO/IEC for the use of such future reserved values. \nA.2  Profiles \nAll constraints for picture parameter sets that are specified in clauses A.2.1 to A.2.11 are constraints for picture parameter \nsets that are activated in the bitstream.

Otherwise, the table entry specifies the value of the variable for the associated limit that is imposed as a requirement \nof bitstream conformance to the profile at the specified level. \nThe use of

The specific frame sizes in \nTable A-6 are illustrative examples only. \n\u2013  As used in Table A-6, \"525\" refers to typical use for environments using 525 analogue scan lines (of which \napproximately 480 lines contain the visible picture region), and \"625\" refers to environments using 625 analogue scan \nlines (of which approximately 576 lines contain the visible picture region). \n\u2013  XGA is also known as (aka) XVGA, 4SVGA aka UXGA, 16XGA aka 4Kx3K, CIF aka 625 SIF, 625 HHR aka 2CIF \naka half 625 D-1, aka half 625 ITU-R BT.601, 525 SD aka 525 D-1 aka 525 ITU-R BT.601, 625 SD aka 625 D-1 aka \n625 ITU-R BT.601. \n\u2013  The given maximum frame rate values that have a zero to the right of the decimal point are exact. Others have been \nrounded to the nearest 0.1 frames per second, i.e., the precise maximum frame rates may be higher or lower within a \nmargin of plus or minus 0.05 frames per second. For example, for Level 4, the maximum frame rate for 720p HD has \nbeen rounded up to 68.3 from a value of 68.2666\u2026, and the maximum frame rate for 1080 HD has been rounded \ndown to 30.1 from a value of 30.1176\u2026. \n\u2013  Frame rates given are correct for progressive scan modes. The frame rates are also correct for interlaced video coding \nfor the cases of frame height divisible by 32. \n \n\nA.3.5  Effect of level limits on maximum DPB size in units of frames (informative) \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nTable A-7 \u2013 Maximum DPB size (frames) for some example frame sizes \n \nLevel:        1  1b  1.1  1.2  1.3  2  2.1  2.2 \nMax frame size (macroblocks):        99  99  396  396  396  396  792  1 620 \nMax DPB size (macroblocks):        396  396  900  2 376  2 376  2 376  4 752  8 100 \nFormat  Luma Width  Luma Height  MBs Total                 \nSQCIF  128  96  48  8  8  16  16  16  16  16  16 \nQCIF  176  144  99  4  4  9  16  16  16  16  16 \nQVGA  320  240  300  -

ITU-T H.222.0 | ISO/IEC 13818-1 systems or Rec. ITU-T H.320 \nsystems. For bit-oriented delivery, the bit order for the byte stream format is specified to start with the MSB of the first \nbyte, proceed to the LSB of the first byte, followed by the MSB of the second byte, etc. \nThe byte stream format consists of a sequence of byte stream NAL unit syntax structures. Each byte stream NAL unit \nsyntax structure contains one start code prefix followed by one nal_unit( NumBytesInNALunit ) syntax structure. It may \n(and under some circumstances, it shall) also contain an additional zero_byte syntax element. It may also contain one or \nmore additional trailing_zero_8bits syntax elements. When it is the first byte stream NAL unit in the bitstream, it may also \ncontain one or more additional leading_zero_8bits syntax elements. \nB.1  Byte stream NAL unit syntax and semantics \nB.1.1  Byte stream NAL unit syntax \n \nbyte_stream_nal_unit( NumBytesInNALunit ) {  C  Descriptor \n  while( next_bits( 24 )  !=  0x000001 &&     \n        next_bits( 32 ) != 0x00000001 ) \n    leading_zero_8bits  /* equal to 0x00 */    f(8) \n  if( next_bits( 24 ) != 0x000001 )     \n    zero_byte  /* equal to 0x00 */    f(8) \n  start_code_prefix_one_3bytes  /* equal to 0x000001 */    f(24) \n  nal_unit( NumBytesInNALunit )     \n  while( more_data_in_byte_stream( ) &&     \n        next_bits( 24 ) != 0x000001 && \n        next_bits( 32 ) != 0x00000001 ) \n    trailing_zero_8bits  /* equal to 0x00 */    f(8) \n}     \nB.1.2  Byte stream NAL unit semantics \nThe order of byte stream NAL units in the byte stream shall follow the decoding order of the NAL units contained in the \nbyte stream NAL units (see clause 7.4.1.2). The content of each byte stream NAL unit is associated with the same access \nunit as the NAL unit contained in the byte stream NAL unit (see clause 7.4.1.2.3). \nleading_zero_8bits is a byte equal to 0x00. \nNOTE \u2013 The leading_zero_8bits syntax element can only be present in the first byte stream NAL unit of the bitstream, because (as \nshown in the syntax diagram of clause B.1.1) any bytes equal to 0x00 that follow a NAL unit syntax structure and precede the four-\nbyte sequence 0x00000001 (which is to be interpreted as a zero_byte followed by a start_code_prefix_one_3bytes) will be \nconsidered to be trailing_zero_8bits syntax elements that are part of the preceding byte stream NAL unit. \nzero_byte is a single byte equal to 0x00. \nWhen any of the following conditions are true, the zero_byte syntax element shall be present: \n\u2013  the nal_unit_type within the nal_unit( ) is equal to 7 (sequence parameter set) or 8 (picture parameter set), \n\u2013  the byte stream NAL unit syntax structure contains the first NAL unit of an access unit in decoding order, as specified \nin clause 7.4.1.2.3. \nstart_code_prefix_one_3bytes is a fixed-value sequence of 3 bytes equal to 0x000001. This syntax element is called a \nstart code prefix. \ntrailing_zero_8bits is a byte equal to 0x00. \n \n\nB.2  Byte stream NAL unit decoding process \nInput to this process consists of an ordered stream of bytes consisting of a sequence of byte stream NAL unit syntax \nstructures. \nOutput of this process consists of a sequence of NAL unit syntax structures. \nAt the beginning of the decoding process, the decoder initializes its current position in the byte stream to the beginning of \nthe byte stream. It then extracts and discards each leading_zero_8bits syntax element (if present), moving the current \nposition in the byte stream forward one byte at a time, until the current position in the byte stream is such that the next four \nbytes in the bitstream form the four-byte sequence 0x00000001. \nThe decoder then performs the following step-wise process repeatedly to extract and decode each NAL unit syntax structure \nin the byte stream until the end of the byte stream has been encountered (as determined by unspecified means) and the last \nNAL unit in the byte stream has been decoded: \n1.  When the next four bytes in the bitstream form the four-byte sequence 0x00000001, the next byte in the byte \nstream (which is a zero_byte syntax element) is extracted and discarded and the current position in the byte stream \nis set equal to the position of the byte following this discarded byte. \n2.  The next three-byte sequence in the byte stream (which is a start_code_prefix_one_3bytes) is extracted and \ndiscarded and the current position in the byte stream is set equal to the position of the byte following this three-byte \nsequence. \n3.  NumBytesInNALunit is set equal to the number of bytes starting with the byte at the current position in the byte \nstream up to and including the last byte that precedes the location of any of the following: \n\u2013  A subsequent byte-aligned three-byte sequence equal to 0x000000, \n\u2013  A subsequent byte-aligned three-byte sequence equal to 0x000001, \n\u2013  The end of the byte stream, as determined by unspecified means. \n4.  NumBytesInNALunit bytes are removed from the bitstream and the current position in the byte stream is advanced \nby NumBytesInNALunit bytes. This sequence of bytes is nal_unit( NumBytesInNALunit ) and is decoded using \nthe NAL unit decoding process. \n5.  When the current position in the byte stream is not at the end of the byte stream (as determined by unspecified \nmeans) and the next bytes in the byte stream do not start with a three-byte sequence equal to 0x000001 and the \nnext bytes in the byte stream do not start with a four byte sequence equal to 0x00000001, the decoder extracts and \ndiscards each trailing_zero_8bits syntax element, moving the current position in the byte stream forward one byte \nat a time, until the current position in the byte stream is such that the next bytes in the byte stream form the four-\nbyte sequence 0x00000001 or the end of the byte stream has been encountered (as determined by unspecified \nmeans). \nB.3  Decoder byte-alignment recovery (informative) \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nMany applications provide data to a decoder in a manner that is inherently byte aligned, and thus have no need for the bit-\noriented byte alignment detection procedure described in this clause. \nA decoder is said to have byte-alignment with a bitstream when the decoder is able to determine whether or not the positions \nof data in the bitstream are byte-aligned. When a decoder does not have byte alignment with the encoder's byte stream, the \ndecoder may examine the incoming bitstream for the binary pattern '00000000 00000000 00000000 00000001' (31 \nconsecutive bits equal to 0 followed by a bit equal to 1). The bit immediately following this pattern is the first bit of an \naligned byte following a start code prefix. Upon detecting this pattern, the decoder will be byte aligned with the encoder \nand positioned at the start of a NAL unit in the byte stream. \nOnce byte aligned with the encoder, the decoder can examine the incoming byte stream for subsequent three-byte sequences \n0x000001 and 0x000003. \nWhen the three-byte sequence 0x000001 is detected, this is a start code prefix. \nWhen the three-byte sequence 0x000003 is detected, the third byte (0x03) is an emulation_prevention_three_byte to be \ndiscarded as specified in clause 7.4.1. \nWhen an error in the bitstream syntax is detected (e.g., a non-zero value of the forbidden_zero_bit or one of the three-byte \nor four-byte sequences that are prohibited in clause 7.4.1), the decoder may consider the detected condition as an indication \nthat byte alignment may have been lost and may discard all bitstream data until the detection of byte alignment at a later \nposition in the bitstream as described in this clause.   \n \n\nAnnex C \n \nHypothetical reference decoder \n \n(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.) \nThis annex specifies the hypothetical reference decoder (HRD) and its use to check bitstream and decoder conformance. \nTwo types of bitstreams are subject to HRD conformance checking for this Recommendation | International Standard. The \nfirst such type of bitstream, called Type I bitstream, is a NAL unit stream containing only the VCL NAL units and filler \ndata NAL units for all access units in the bitstream. The second type of bitstream, called a Type II bitstream, contains, in \naddition to the VCL NAL units and filler data NAL units for all access units in the bitstream, at least one of the following: \n\u2013  additional non-VCL NAL units other than filler data NAL units, \n\u2013  all leading_zero_8bits, zero_byte, start_code_prefix_one_3bytes, and trailing_zero_8bits syntax elements that form a \nbyte stream from the NAL unit stream (as specified in Annex B). \nFigure C-1 shows the types of bitstream conformance points checked by the HRD. \nNon-VCL NAL units other\nVCL NAL units than filter data NAL units\nFilter data NAL units\nByte stream format\nencapsulation\n(see Annex B)\nH.264(09)_FC-1  \nFigure C-1 \u2013 Structure of byte streams and NAL unit streams for HRD conformance checks \nThe syntax elements of non-VCL NAL units (or their default values for some of the syntax elements), required for the \nHRD, are specified in the semantics subclauses of clause 7, Annexes D and E, and clauses G.7, G.13, G.14, H.7, H.13, \nH.14, I.7, I.13, and I.14. \nTwo types of HRD parameter sets (NAL HRD parameters and VCL HRD parameters) are used. The HRD parameter sets \nare signalled as follows: \n\u2013  When the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A and the decoding \nprocess specified in clauses 2 to 9 is applied, the HRD parameter sets are signalled through video usability information \nas specified in clauses E.1 and E.2, which is part of the sequence parameter set syntax structure. \n\u2013  When the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G and the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex G is applied, the HRD parameter sets are signalled through the SVC video usability \ninformation extension as specified in clauses G.14.1 and G.14.2, which is part of the subset sequence parameter set \nsyntax structure. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 For coded video sequences that conform to both, one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A and one or more of the \nprofiles specified in Annex G, the signalling of the applicable HRD parameter sets is depending on whether the decoding process \nspecified in clauses 2 to 9 or the decoding process specified in Annex G is applied. \n\u2013  When the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex H and the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex H is applied, the HRD parameter sets are signalled through the MVC video usability \ninformation extension as specified in clauses H.14.1 and H.14.2, which is part of the subset sequence parameter set \nsyntax structure. \n \n\nNOTE 2 \u2013 For coded video sequences that conform to both, one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A and one or more of the \nprofiles specified in Annex H, the signalling of the applicable HRD parameter sets is depending on whether the decoding process \nspecified in clauses 2 to 9 or the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied. \n\u2013  When the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I and the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I is applied, the HRD parameter sets are signalled through the MVC video usability information \nextension as specified in clause I.14, which is part of the subset sequence parameter set syntax structure. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 For coded video sequences that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex H and one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I, the signalling of the applicable HRD parameter sets is \ndependent on whether the decoding process specified in clauses 2-9, the decoding process specified in Annex H, or the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex I is applied. \nAll sequence parameter sets and picture parameter sets referred to in the VCL NAL units, and corresponding buffering \nperiod and picture timing SEI messages shall be conveyed to the HRD, in a timely manner, either in the bitstream (by non-\nVCL NAL units), or by other means not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \nIn Annexes C, D, and E and clauses G.12, G.13, G.14, H.12, H.13, H.14, I.13 and I.14 the specification for \"presence\" of \nnon-VCL NAL units is also satisfied when those NAL units (or just some of them) are conveyed to decoders (or to the \nHRD) by other means not specified by this Recommendation | International Standard. For the purpose of counting bits, \nonly the appropriate bits that are actually present in the bitstream are counted. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 As an example, synchronization of a non-VCL NAL unit, conveyed by means other than presence in the bitstream, with \nthe NAL units that are present in the bitstream, can be achieved by indicating two points in the bitstream, between which the \nnon-VCL NAL unit would have been present in the bitstream, had the encoder decided to convey it in the bitstream. \nWhen the content of a non-VCL NAL unit is conveyed for the application by some means other than presence within the \nbitstream, the representation of the content of the non-VCL NAL unit is not required to use the same syntax specified in \nthis annex. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 When HRD information is contained within the bitstream, it is possible to verify the conformance of a bitstream to the \nrequirements of this clause based solely on information contained in the bitstream. When the HRD information is not present in the \nbitstream, as is the case for all \"stand-alone\" Type I bitstreams, conformance can only be verified when the HRD data is supplied \nby some other means not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThe HRD contains a coded picture buffer (CPB), an instantaneous decoding process, a decoded picture buffer (DPB), and \noutput cropping as shown in Figure C-2. \n \n\nHypothetical\nstream scheduler\n(HSS)\nType I or Type II bitstream\nCoded picture\nbuffer (CPB)\nAccess units\nDecoding process\n(instantaneous)\nReference Pictures\nfields or frames\nDecoded picture\nbuffer (DPB)\nPictures\nOutput cropping\nOutput cropped pictures\nH.264(13)_FC-2  \nFigure C-2 \u2013 HRD buffer model \nThe  CPB  size  (number  of  bits)  is  CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ].  The  DPB  size  (number  of  frame  buffers)  is \nMax( 1, max_dec_frame_buffering ). When the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex H and the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the DPB size is specified in units of view components. \nWhen the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I and the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I is applied, the DPB is operated separately for texture view components and depth view components \nand the terms texture DPB and depth DPB are used, respectively. The texture DPB size is specified in units of texture view \ncomponents and the depth DPB size is specified in units of depth view components. \nThe HRD operates as follows. Data associated with access units that flow into the CPB according to a specified arrival \nschedule are delivered by the HSS. The data associated with each access unit are removed and decoded instantaneously by \nthe instantaneous decoding process at CPB removal times. Each decoded picture is placed in the DPB at its CPB removal \ntime unless it is output at its CPB removal time and is a non-reference picture. When a picture is placed in the DPB it is \nremoved from the DPB at the later of the DPB output time or the time that it is marked as \"unused for reference\". \nFor each picture in the bitstream, the variable OutputFlag for the decoded picture and, when applicable, the reference base \npicture, is set as follows: \n\u2013  If the coded video sequence containing the picture conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A and \nthe decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9 is applied, OutputFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the coded video sequence containing the picture conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex G and the decoding process specified in Annex G is applied, the following applies: \n\u2013  For a reference base picture, OutputFlag is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  For a decoded picture, OutputFlag is set equal to the value of the output_flag syntax element of the target layer \nrepresentation. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the coded video sequence containing the picture conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex H and the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the following applies: \n\u2013  For the decoded view components of the target output views, OutputFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  For the decoded view components of other views, OutputFlag is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the coded video sequence containing the picture conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex I and the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied), the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  For the decoded texture view components and corresponding depth view components with the same VOIdx as \nthe target output views, OutputFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  For the decoded texture view components and corresponding depth view components with the same VOIdx as \nother views, OutputFlag is set equal to 0. \nThe operation of the CPB is specified in clause C.1. The instantaneous decoder operation is specified in clauses 2 to 9 (for \ncoded video sequences conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A) and in Annex G (for coded video \nsequences conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G) and in Annex H (for coded video sequences \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex H) and in Annex I (for coded video sequences conforming \nto one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I). The operation of the DPB is specified in clause C.2. The output \ncropping is specified in clause C.2.2. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 Coded video sequences that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, and at the same time, one or \nmore of the profiles specified in Annex G can be decoded either by the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9 or by the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex G. The decoding result and the HRD operation may be dependent on which of the decoding processes is \napplied. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 Coded video sequences that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, and at the same time, one or \nmore of the profiles specified in Annex H can be decoded either by the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9 or by the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex H. The decoding result and the HRD operation may be dependent on which of the decoding processes is \napplied. \nNOTE 8 \u2013 Coded video sequences that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex H, and one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I, can be decoded either by the decoding process specified \nin clauses 2 to 9, by the decoding process specified in Annex H or by the decoding process specified in Annex I. The decoding result \nand the HRD operation may be dependent on which of the decoding processes is applied. \nHSS and HRD information concerning the number of enumerated delivery schedules and their associated bit rates and \nbuffer sizes is specified in clauses E.1.1, E.1.2, E.2.1, E.2.2, G.14.1, G.14.2, H.14.1, H.14.2 and I.14. The HRD is initialized \nas specified by the buffering period SEI message as specified in clauses D.1.2 and D.2.1. The removal timing of access \nunits from the CPB and output timing from the DPB are specified in the picture timing SEI message as specified in \nclauses D.1.3 and D.2.3. All timing information relating to a specific access unit shall arrive prior to the CPB removal time \nof the access unit. \nWhen the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G and the decoding process \nspecified in Annex G is applied, the following is specified: \n(a)  When an access unit contains one or more buffering period SEI messages that are included in scalable nesting \nSEI  messages  and  are  associated  with  values  of  DQId  in  the  range  of  ( ( DQIdMax >> 4) << 4 )  to \n( ( ( DQIdMax >> 4 ) << 4 ) + 15 ), inclusive, the last of these buffering period SEI messages in decoding order \nis  the  buffering  period  SEI  message  that  initializes  the  HRD.

Let hrdVId[ i ] be equal to sei_op_view_id[ i ] for \nall i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, and let hrdTId be the value of \n \n\nsei_op_temporal_id, that are associated with the MVC scalable nesting SEI message containing the buffering \nperiod SEI message that initializes the HRD. \n(b)  The picture timing SEI messages that specify the removal timing of access units from the CPB and output timing \nfrom the DPB are the picture timing SEI messages that are included in MVC scalable nesting SEI messages \nassociated  with  values  of  sei_op_view_id[ i ]  equal  to  hrdVId[ i ]  for  all  i  in  the  range  of  0  to \nnum_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, and sei_temporal_id equal to hrdTId. \n(c)  The HRD parameters that are used for conformance checking are the HRD parameters included in the MVC \nvideo usability information extension of the active MVC sequence parameter set that are associated with values \nof vui_mvc_view_id[ i ][ j ] for all j in the range of 0 to vui_mvc_num_target_output_views_minus1[ i ], \ninclusive, equal to hrdVId[ j ], and the value of vui_mvc_temporal_id[ i ] equal to hrdTId.

For example, the number \nof bits in a CPB just prior to or after removal of an access unit is not necessarily an integer. \nThe variable t is derived as follows and is called a clock tick: \nc\nt = num_units_in_tick \u00f7 time_scale    (C-1) \nc\nThe following is specified for expressing the constraints in this annex: \n\u2013  Let access unit n be the n-th access unit in decoding order with the first access unit being access unit 0. \n\u2013  Let picture n be the primary coded picture or the decoded primary picture of access unit n. \nC.1  Operation of coded picture buffer (CPB) \nThe specifications in this clause apply independently to each set of CPB parameters that is present and to both the Type I \nand Type II conformance points shown in Figure C-1. \n \n\nC.1.1  Timing of bitstream arrival \nThe HRD may be initialized at any one of the buffering period SEI messages. Prior to initialization, the CPB is empty. \nNOTE \u2013 After initialization, the HRD is not initialized again by subsequent buffering period SEI messages. \nEach access unit is referred to as access unit n, where the number n identifies the particular access unit. The access unit \nthat is associated with the buffering period SEI message that initializes the CPB is referred to as access unit 0. The value \nof n is incremented by 1 for each subsequent access unit in decoding order. \nThe time at which the first bit of access unit n begins to enter the CPB is referred to as the initial arrival time t ( n ). \nai\nThe initial arrival time of access units is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If the access unit is access unit 0, t ( 0 ) = 0, \nai\n\u2013  Otherwise (the access unit is access unit n with n > 0), the following applies: \n\u2013  If cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ] is equal to 1, the initial arrival time for access unit n, is equal to the final arrival time \n(which is derived below) of access unit n \u2212 1, i.e., \nt ( n ) = t ( n \u2212 1 )    (C-2) \nai af\n\u2013  Otherwise (cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ] is equal to 0), the initial arrival time for access unit n is derived by \nt ( n ) = Max( t ( n \u2212 1 ), t ( n ) )    (C-3) \nai af ai,earliest\nwhere t ( n ) is derived as follows: \nai,earliest\n\u2013  If access unit n is not the first access unit of a subsequent buffering period, t ( n ) is derived as \nai,earliest\ntai,earliest( n ) = tr,n( n ) \u2212 ( initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] + \n                                       initial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[ SchedSelIdx ] ) \u00f7 90000  (C-4) \nwith t ( n ) being the nominal removal time of access unit n from the CPB as specified in clause C.1.2 and \nr,n\ninitial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ]  and  initial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[ SchedSelIdx ]  being \nspecified in the previous buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise (access unit n is the first access unit of a subsequent buffering period), t ( n ) is derived as \nai,earliest\nt ( n ) = t ( n ) \u2212 ( initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] \u00f7 90000 )  (C-5) \nai,earliest r,n\nwith  initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ]  being  specified  in  the  buffering  period  SEI  message \nassociated with access unit n. \nThe final arrival time for access unit n is derived by \nt ( n ) = t ( n ) + b( n ) \u00f7 BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ]    (C-6) \naf ai\nwhere b( n ) is the size in bits of access unit n, counting the bits of the VCL NAL units and the filler data NAL units for \nthe Type I conformance point or all bits of the Type II bitstream for the Type II conformance point, where the Type I and \nType II conformance points are as shown in Figure C-1. \nThe values of SchedSelIdx, BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ], and CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] are constrained as follows: \n\u2013  If the content of the active sequence parameter sets for access unit n and access unit n \u2212 1 differ, the HSS selects a \nvalue SchedSelIdx1 of SchedSelIdx from among the values of SchedSelIdx provided in the active sequence parameter \nset for access unit n that results in a BitRate[ SchedSelIdx1 ] or CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx1 ] for access unit n. The value \nof BitRate[ SchedSelIdx1 ] or CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx1 ] may differ from the value of BitRate[ SchedSelIdx0 ] or \nCpbSize[ SchedSelIdx0 ] for the value SchedSelIdx0 of SchedSelIdx that was in use for access unit n \u2212 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the HSS continues to operate with the previous values of SchedSelIdx, BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] and \nCpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ]. \nWhen the HSS selects values of BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] or CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] that differ from those of the previous \naccess unit, the following applies: \n\u2013  the variable BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] comes into effect at time t ( n ) \nai\n\u2013  the variable CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] comes into effect as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  If the new value of CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] exceeds the old CPB size, it comes into effect at time t ( n ), \nai\n\u2013  Otherwise, the new value of CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] comes into effect at the time t( n ). \nr\nC.1.2  Timing of coded picture removal \nWhen an access unit n is the access unit with n equal to 0 (the access unit that initializes the HRD), the nominal removal \ntime of the access unit from the CPB is specified by \nt ( 0 ) = initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] \u00f7 90000  (C-7) \nr,n\nWhen an access unit n is the first access unit of a buffering period that does not initialize the HRD, the nominal removal \ntime of the access unit from the CPB is specified by \nt ( n ) = t ( n  ) + t * cpb_removal_delay( n )    (C-8) \nr,n r,n b c\nwhere  t ( n  )  is  the  nominal  removal  time  of  the  first  access  unit  of  the  previous  buffering  period  and \nr,n b\ncpb_removal_delay( n ) is the value of cpb_removal_delay specified in the picture timing SEI message associated with \naccess unit n. \nThe nominal removal time t (n) of an access unit n that is not the first access unit of a buffering period is given by \nr,n\nt ( n ) = t ( n  ) + t * cpb_removal_delay( n )    (C-9) \nr,n r,n b c\nwhere  t ( n  )  is  the  nominal  removal  time  of  the  first  access  unit  of  the  current  buffering  period  and \nr,n b\ncpb_removal_delay( n ) is the value of cpb_removal_delay specified in the picture timing SEI message associated with \naccess unit n. \nThe removal time of access unit n is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If low_delay_hrd_flag is equal to 0 or t ( n ) >= t ( n ), the removal time of access unit n is specified by \nr,n af\nt( n ) = t ( n )    (C-10) \nr r,n\n\u2013  Otherwise (low_delay_hrd_flag is equal to 1 and t ( n ) < t ( n )), the removal time of access unit n is specified by \nr,n af\nt( n ) = t ( n ) + t * Ceil( ( t ( n ) \u2212 t ( n ) ) \u00f7\uf020t )    (C-11) \nr r,n c af r,n c\nNOTE \u2013 The latter case indicates that the size of access unit n, b( n ), is so large that it prevents removal at the nominal removal \ntime. \nWhen an access unit n is the first access unit of a buffering period, n  is set equal to n at the removal time t( n ) of the \nb r\naccess unit n. \nC.2  Operation of the decoded picture buffer (DPB) \nThe decoded picture buffer contains frame buffers. When a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex A is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, each of the frame buffers \nmay contain a decoded frame, a decoded complementary field pair or a single (non-paired) decoded field that is marked as \n\"used for reference\" (reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed pictures).

When a coded \nvideo sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I, each of the frame buffers of the texture DPB may contain: a decoded depth frame view component, \na decoded complementary texture field view component pair, or a single (non-paired) decoded texture field view \ncomponent that is marked as \"used for reference\" (reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed \npictures) or is held as reference for inter-view prediction (inter-view only reference components). When a coded video \nsequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I, each of the frame buffers of the depth DPB may contain a decoded depth frame view component, a \ndecoded complementary depth field view component pair, or a single (non-paired) decoded depth field view component \n \n\nthat is marked as \"used for reference\" (reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed pictures) or is \nheld as reference for inter-view prediction (inter-view only reference components). \nPrior to initialization, the DPB is empty (the DPB fullness is set to zero). The following steps specified in this clause all \nhappen instantaneously at t( n ) and in the order listed. When the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is \nr\napplied, the view components of the current primary coded picture are processed by applying the ordered steps to each \nview component in increasing order of the associated view order index VOIdx. During the invocation of the process for a \nparticular texture view, only the texture view components of the particular view are considered. During the invocation of \nthe process for a particular depth view, only the depth view components of the particular view are considered. For each \nview component of the current primary coded picture, the corresponding depth view component with the same view order \nindex VOIdx, if present, is processed after the texture view component. \n1.  The process of decoding gaps in frame_num and storing \"non-existing\" frames as specified in clause C.2.1 is \ninvoked. \n2.  The picture decoding and output process as specified in clause C.2.2 is invoked. \n3.  The process of removing pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture as specified in \nclause C.2.3 is invoked. \n4.  The process of marking and storing the current decoded picture as specified in clause C.2.4 is invoked. \nNOTE \u2013 When the decoding process specified in Annex G is applied, the DPB is only operated for decoded pictures and \nreference base pictures associated with decoded pictures. The DPB is not operated for layer pictures with dependency_id less \nthan DependencyIdMax (and associated reference base pictures). All decoded pictures and associated reference base pictures are \ndecoded pictures and associated reference base pictures for dependency_id equal to DependencyIdMax, which represent the \nresults of the decoding process specified in clause G.8. \nC.2.1  Decoding of gaps in frame_num and storage of \"non-existing\" frames \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame \nview component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". During the invocation of the process for a \nparticular view, only view components of the particular view are considered and view components of other views are not \nmarked as \"unused for reference\" or removed from the DPB. When the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, \nthe process specified in this clause for Annex H is invoked for particular texture view or depth view with view order index \nVOIdx, with each \"view component\" being replaced by \"texture view component\" or \"depth view component\", \"frame \nview component\" being replaced by \"texture frame view component\" or \"depth frame view component\", and \"field view \ncomponent\" being replaced by \"texture field view component\". During the invocation of the process for a particular texture \nview, only the texture view components of the particular view are considered and during the invocation of the process for \na particular depth view, only the depth view components of the particular view are considered and view components of \nother views are not marked as \"unused for reference\" or removed from the DPB. \nThe DPB fullness represents the total number of non-empty frame buffers. When the decoding process specified in \nAnnex H is applied; this includes frame buffers that contain view components of other views. When the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I is applied, this includes frame buffers that contain texture or depth view components of other views. \nWhen applicable, gaps in frame_num are detected by the decoding process and the generated frames are marked and \ninserted into the DPB as specified below. \nGaps in frame_num are detected by the decoding process and the generated frames are marked as specified in \nclauses 8.2.5.2 and G.8.2.5. \nAfter the marking of each generated frame, each picture m marked by the \"sliding window\" process as \"unused for \nreference\" is removed from the DPB when it is also marked as \"non-existing\" or its DPB output time is less than or equal \nto the CPB removal time of the current picture n; i.e., to,dpb( m ) <= tr( n ), or it has OutputFlag equal to 0. When a frame or \nthe last field in a frame buffer is removed from the DPB, the DPB fullness is decremented by one. The \"non-existing\" \ngenerated frame is inserted into the DPB and the DPB fullness is incremented by one. \nC.2.2  Picture decoding and output \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \ntexture view or depth view with view order index VOIdx. \nThe decoding of the current picture or view component (when applying the decoding process specified in Annex H or \nAnnex I) and the derivation of the DPB output time (if applicable) is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the decoding process specified in clause 8 or Annex G is applied, the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  The current primary coded picture n is decoded. \n\u2013  When picture n has OutputFlag equal to 1, its DPB output time t ( n ) is derived by \no,dpb\nt ( n ) = t( n ) + t * dpb_output_delay( n )   (C-12) \no,dpb r c\nwhere dpb_output_delay( n ) is the value of dpb_output_delay specified in the picture timing SEI message \nassociated with access unit n. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied), the following applies: \n\u2013  The view component with view order index VOIdx of the current primary coded picture n is decoded. \n\u2013  When VOIdx is equal to VOIdxMin and any of the view components of picture n has OutputFlag equal to 1, the \nDPB output time t ( n ) for picture n is derived by Equation C-12, where dpb_output_delay( n ) is the value \no,dpb\nof dpb_output_delay specified in the picture timing SEI message associated with access unit n. \nThe output of the current picture or view component (when applying the decoding process specified in Annex H) is \nspecified as follows: \n\u2013  If OutputFlag is equal to 1 and t ( n ) = t( n ), the current picture or view component is output. \no,dpb r\nNOTE 1 \u2013 When the current picture or view component has nal_ref_idc greater than 0 (when using the decoding process \nspecified in Annex G, nal_ref_idc is the syntax element of the target layer representation), it will be stored in the DPB. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if OutputFlag is equal to 0, the current picture or view component is not output, but it may be stored in the \nDPB as specified in clause C.2.4. \n\u2013  Otherwise (OutputFlag is equal to 1 and t ( n ) > t( n ) ), the current picture or view component is output later and \no,dpb r\nwill be stored in the DPB (as specified in clause C.2.4) and is output at time t ( n ) unless indicated not to be output \no,dpb\nby the decoding or inference of no_output_of_prior_pics_flag equal to 1 at a time that precedes t ( n ). \no,dpb\nNOTE 2 \u2013 When the coded video sequence conforms to a profile specified in Annex H and the decoding process specified in \nAnnex H is used, the view components of all the target output views of a picture are output at the same time instant and in \nincreasing order of the view order index VOIdx. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When the coded video sequence conforms to a profile specified in Annex I and the decoding process specified in \nAnnex I is used, the view components of all the target output views of a picture are output at the same time instant and in \nincreasing order of the view order index VOIdx. A depth view component, if present, follows the texture view component \nwithin the same view component. \nWhen output, the picture or view component shall be cropped, using the cropping rectangle specified in the active sequence \nparameter set for the picture or view component. \nWhen the decoding process specified in clause 8 or Annex G is applied, the current picture n is a picture that is output and \nis not the last picture of the bitstream that is output, the value of \uf044t ( n ) is derived by \no,dpb\n\uf044t ( n ) = t ( n  ) \u2212 t ( n )    (C-13) \no,dpb o,dpb n o,dpb\nwhere n  indicates the picture that follows after picture n in output order and has OutputFlag equal to 1. \nn\nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied, the current picture n is a picture that contains at \nleast one view component that is output and the current picture is not the last picture of the bitstream that contains at least \none view component that is output and VOIdx is equal to VOIdxMin, the value of \uf044t ( n ) is derived by Equation C-13, \no,dpb\nwhere n  indicates the picture that follows after picture n in output order and contains at least one any view component \nn\nwith OutputFlag equal to 1. \nThe decoded picture or view component is temporarily stored (not in the DPB). \nC.2.3  Removal of pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame \nview component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, the process specified in this clause for Annex I is invoked for \nparticular texture view and depth view with view order index VOIdx, with each \"view component\" being replaced by \n\"texture view component\" or \"depth view component\", \"frame view component\" being replaced by \"texture frame view \ncomponent\" or \"depth frame view component\", and \"field view component\" being replaced by \"texture field view \ncomponent\". During the invocation of the process for a particular texture view, only the texture view components of the \nparticular view are considered and during the invocation of the process for a particular depth view, only the depth view \ncomponents of the particular view are considered. \n \n\nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied, the following process is specified for removing \ninter-view only reference components of the current access unit from the DPB. By this process, view components of the \ncurrent view with view order index VOIdx are not removed from the DPB, but inter-view only reference components of \nother views may be removed. The removal of inter-view only reference components is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the view order index VOIdx of the current view is equal to VOIdxMax, all inter-view only reference components \nm for which any of the following conditions are true are removed from the DPB: \n\u2013  OutputFlag is equal to 0, \n\u2013  The DPB output time t ( m ) of the picture containing the view component m is less than or equal to the CPB \no,dpb\nremoval time t( n ) of the current picture. \nr\n\u2013  Otherwise (the view order index VOIdx of the current view is less than VOIdxMax), all inter-view only reference \ncomponents m for which both of the following conditions are true are removed from the DPB: \n\u2013  OutputFlag is equal to 0 or the DPB output time t ( m ) of the picture containing the view component m is \no,dpb\nless than or equal to the CPB removal time t( n ) of the current picture, \nr\n\u2013  One of the following conditions is true: \n\u2013  The current view component is a view component of an anchor picture and the view_id of the inter-view \nonly reference component m is not equal to any value of anchor_ref_lX[ k ][ j ], with X being equal to 0 \nor 1, k being any integer value greater than the view order index VOIdx of the current view, and j being any \ninteger value in the range of 0 to Max( 0, num_anchor_refs_lX[ k ] \u2212 1 ), inclusive, \n\u2013  The current view component is not a view component of an anchor picture and the view_id of the inter-view \nonly reference component m is not equal to any value of non_anchor_ref_lX[ k ][ j ], with X being equal \nto 0 or 1, k being any integer value greater than the view order index VOIdx of the current view, and j being \nany integer value in the range of 0 to Max( 0, num_non_anchor_refs_lX[ k ] \u2212 1 ), inclusive. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, for the following processes specified in this clause, only view \ncomponents of the particular view for which this clause is invoked are considered, and view components of other views \nare not marked as \"unused for reference\" or removed from the DPB. When the decoding process specified in Annex I is \napplied, for the following processes specified for Annex I in this clause, during the invocation of the process for a particular \ntexture view, only texture view components of the particular texture view are considered and during the invocation of the \nprocess for a particular depth view, only depth view components of the particular depth view are considered, and view \ncomponents of other views are not marked as \"unused for reference\" or removed from the DPB. \nThe DPB fullness represents the total number of non-empty frame buffers.

When the decoding \nprocess specified in Annex I is applied, this includes frame buffers that contain texture or depth view components of other \nviews. \nThe removal of pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture proceeds as follows: \n\u2013  If the decoded picture is an IDR picture the following applies: \n1.  All reference pictures in the DPB are marked as \"unused for reference\" as specified in clause 8.2.5.1 when a coded \nvideo sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A is decoded by applying the \ndecoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, or as specified in clause G.8.2.4 when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex G, or as specified in clause H.8.3 when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of \nthe profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex H, or as \nspecified in clause I.8.3 when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex I is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I. \n2.  When the IDR picture is not the first IDR picture decoded and the value of PicWidthInMbs or FrameHeightInMbs \nor max_dec_frame_buffering derived from the active sequence parameter set is different from the value of \nPicWidthInMbs or FrameHeightInMbs or max_dec_frame_buffering derived from the sequence parameter set \nthat was active for the preceding picture, respectively, no_output_of_prior_pics_flag is inferred to be equal to 1 \nby the HRD, regardless of the actual value of no_output_of_prior_pics_flag. \nNOTE \u2013 Decoder implementations should try to handle frame or DPB size changes more gracefully than the HRD in \nregard to changes in PicWidthInMbs or FrameHeightInMbs. \n3.  When no_output_of_prior_pics_flag is equal to 1 or is inferred to be equal to 1, all frame buffers in the DPB are \nemptied without output of the pictures they contain, and DPB fullness is set to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the decoded picture is not an IDR picture), the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  If the slice header of the current picture includes memory_management_control_operation equal to 5, all \nreference pictures in the DPB are marked as \"unused for reference\". \n\u2013  Otherwise (the slice header of the current picture does not include memory_management_control_operation \nequal to 5), the decoded reference picture marking process specified in clause 8.2.5 is invoked when a coded \nvideo sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A is decoded by applying the \ndecoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, or the decoded reference picture marking process specified in \nclause G.8.2.4 is invoked when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex G is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex G, or the decoded reference picture \nmarking process specified in clause H.8.3 is invoked when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more \nof the profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex H, or the \ndecoded reference picture marking process specified in clause I.8.3 is invoked when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I. \nAll pictures m in the DPB, for which all of the following conditions are true, are removed from the DPB: \n\u2013  picture m is marked as \"unused for reference\" or picture m is a non-reference picture. When a picture is a reference \nframe, it is considered to be marked as \"unused for reference\" only when both of its fields have been marked as \n\"unused for reference\", \n\u2013  picture m is marked as \"non-existing\" or it has OutputFlag equal to 0 or its DPB output time t ( m ) is less than or \no,dpb\nequal to the CPB removal time t( n ) of the current picture n. \nr\nWhen a frame or the last field in a frame buffer is removed from the DPB, the DPB fullness is decremented by one. \nC.2.4  Current decoded picture marking and storage \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame \nview component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". When the decoding process specified in Annex I \nis applied, the process specified in this clause for Annex I is invoked for particular texture view and depth view with view \norder index VOIdx, with each \"view component\" being replaced by \"texture view component\" and \"depth view \ncomponent\", \"frame view component\" being replaced by \"texture frame view component\" and \"depth frame view \ncomponent\", and \"field view component\" being replaced by \"texture field view component\". In clause C.2.4.2, the DPB \noutput time t (n) and the CPB removal time t(n) of a view component are the DPB output time and the CPB removal \no,dpb r\ntime of the picture n containing the view component. \nThe marking and storage of the current decoded picture is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the current picture is a reference picture, the marking and storage process for reference pictures as specified in \nclause C.2.4.1 is invoked. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture is a non-reference picture), the storage process for non-reference pictures as specified \nin clause C.2.4.2 is invoked. \nC.2.4.1  Marking and storage of a reference picture into the DPB \nThe current picture is stored in the DPB as follows: \n\u2013  If the current decoded picture is a second field (in decoding order) of a complementary reference field pair, and the \nfirst field of the pair is still in the DPB, the current decoded picture is stored in the same frame buffer as the first field \nof the pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the current decoded picture is stored in an empty frame buffer, and the DPB fullness is incremented by \none. \nWhen the coded video sequence conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G and the decoding process \nspecified in Annex G is applied and the current picture has store_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 1 (i.e., the current picture is \nassociated with a reference base picture), the associated reference base picture is stored in the DPB as follows: \n\u2013  If the reference base picture is a second field (in decoding order) of a complementary reference base field pair, and \nthe first field of the pair is still in the DPB, the reference base picture is stored in the same frame buffer as the first \nfield of the pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the reference base picture is stored in an empty frame buffer, and the DPB fullness is incremented by one. \nC.2.4.2  Storage of a non-reference picture into the DPB \nThe variable storePicFlag is derived as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  If any of the following conditions are true, storePicFlag is set equal to 1: \n\u2013  the current picture n has OutputFlag equal to 1 and t (n) > t(n), \no,dpb r\n\u2013  the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is used and the current view component has a view order \nindex VOIdx less than VOIdxMax and inter_view_flag equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, storePicFlag is set equal to 0. \nWhen storePicFlag is equal to 1, the current picture is stored in the DPB as follows: \n\u2013  If the current decoded picture is a second field (in decoding order) of a complementary non-reference field pair, and \nthe first field of the pair is still in the DPB, the current decoded picture is stored in the same frame buffer as the first \nfield of the pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the current decoded picture is stored in an empty frame buffer, and the DPB fullness is incremented by \none. \nC.3  Bitstream conformance \nA bitstream of coded data conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard fulfils the following requirements. \nThe  bitstream  is  constructed  according  to  the  syntax,  semantics,  and  constraints  specified  in  this \nRecommendation | International Standard outside of this annex. \nThe bitstream is tested by the HRD as specified below: \nFor Type I bitstreams, the number of tests carried out is equal to cpb_cnt_minus1 + 1 where cpb_cnt_minus1 is either the \nsyntax element of hrd_parameters( ) following the vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag or is determined by the application \nby other means not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. One test is carried out for each bit rate and \nCPB size combination specified by hrd_parameters( ) following the vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag. Each of these tests \nis conducted at the Type I conformance point shown in Figure C-1. \nFor Type II bitstreams there are two sets of tests. The number of tests of the first set is equal to cpb_cnt_minus1 + 1 where \ncpb_cnt_minus1 is either the syntax element of hrd_parameters( ) following the vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag or is \ndetermined by the application by other means not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. One test is \ncarried out for each bit rate and CPB size combination. Each of these tests is conducted at the Type I conformance point \nshown in Figure C-1. For these tests, only VCL and filler data NAL units are counted for the input bit rate and CPB storage. \nThe number of tests of the second set, for Type II bitstreams, is equal to cpb_cnt_minus1 + 1 where cpb_cnt_minus1 is \neither the syntax element of hrd_parameters( ) following the nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag or is determined by the \napplication by other means not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. One test is carried out for each \nbit rate and CPB size combination specified by hrd_parameters( ) following the nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag. Each of \nthese tests is conducted at the Type II conformance point shown in Figure C-1. For these tests, all NAL units (of a Type II \nNAL unit stream) or all bytes (of a byte stream) are counted for the input bit rate and CPB storage. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 NAL HRD parameters established by a value of SchedSelIdx for the Type II conformance point shown in Figure C-1 are \nsufficient to also establish VCL HRD conformance for the Type I conformance point shown in Figure C-1 for the same values of \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ],  BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ],  and  CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ]  for  the  VBR  case \n(cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ] equal to 0). This is because the data flow into the Type I conformance point is a subset of the data flow \ninto the Type II conformance point and because, for the VBR case, the CPB is allowed to become empty and stay empty until the \ntime a next picture is scheduled to begin to arrive. For example, when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the \nprofiles specified in Annex A is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, when NAL HRD parameters \nare provided for the Type II conformance point that not only fall within the bounds set for NAL HRD parameters for profile \nconformance in item j) of clause A.3.1 or item h) of clause A.3.3 (depending on the profile in use) but also fall within the bounds \nset for VCL HRD parameters for profile conformance in item i) of clause A.3.1 or item g) of clause A.3.3 (depending on the profile \nin use), conformance of the VCL HRD for the Type I conformance point is also assured to fall within the bounds of item i) of \nclause A.3.1. \nFor conforming bitstreams, all of the following conditions shall be fulfilled for each of the tests: \n1.  For each access unit n, with n>0, associated with a buffering period SEI message, with \uf044t ( n ) specified by \ng,90\n\uf044t ( n ) = 90000 * ( t ( n ) \u2212 t ( n \u2212 1 ) )    (C-14) \ng,90 r,n af\nthe value of initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] shall be constrained as follows: \n\u2013  If cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ] is equal to 0, \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] <= Ceil( \uf044t ( n ) )  (C-15) \ng,90\n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise (cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ] is equal to 1), \nFloor( \uf044t ( n ) ) <= initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] <= Ceil( \uf044t ( n ) )  (C-16) \ng,90 g,90\nNOTE 2 \u2013 The exact number of bits in the CPB at the removal time of each picture may depend on which buffering \nperiod SEI message is selected to initialize the HRD. Encoders must take this into account to ensure that all specified \nconstraints must be obeyed regardless of which buffering period SEI message is selected to initialize the HRD, as the \nHRD may be initialized at any one of the buffering period SEI messages. \n2.  A CPB overflow is specified as the condition in which the total number of bits in the CPB is larger than the CPB \nsize. The CPB shall never overflow. \n3.  A CPB underflow is specified as the condition in which t ( n ) is less than t ( n ). When low_delay_hrd_flag is \nr,n af\nequal to 0, the CPB shall never underflow. \n4.  The nominal removal times of pictures from the CPB (starting from the second picture in decoding order), shall \nsatisfy the constraints on t ( n ) and t( n ) expressed in clauses A.3.1 through A.3.3 for the profile and level \nr,n r\nspecified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex A is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, and they shall satisfy the \nconstraints on t ( n ) and t( n ) expressed in clauses G.10.2.1 and G.10.2.2 for profile and level specified in the \nr,n r\nbitstream when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G is decoded \nby applying the decoding process specified in Annex G, and they shall satisfy the constraints on t ( n ) and t( n ) \nr,n r\nexpressed in clause H.10.2 for the profile and level specified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex H, and they shall satisfy the constraints on t ( n ) and t( n ) expressed in clause I.10.2 for the \nr,n r\nprofile and level specified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex I is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I. \n5.  Immediately after any decoded picture is added to the DPB, the fullness of the DPB shall be less than or equal to \nthe DPB size as constrained by Annexes A, D, and E and clauses G.10, G.13, G.14, H.10, H.13, H.14, and I.14 for \nthe profile and level specified in the bitstream. \n6.  All reference pictures shall be present in the DPB when needed for prediction. Each picture shall be present in the \nDPB at its DPB output time unless it is not stored in the DPB at all, or is removed from the DPB before its output \ntime by one of the processes specified in clause C.2. \n7.  The value of \uf044 ( n ) as given by Equation C-13, which is the difference between the output time of a picture and \nto,dpb\nthat of the first picture following it in output order and having OutputFlag equal to 1, shall satisfy the constraint \nexpressed in clause A.3.1 for the profile and level specified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in clauses 2 to 9, and it shall satisfy the constraint expressed in clause G.10.2.1 for profile and level \nspecified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex G is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex G, and it shall satisfy the constraints \nexpressed in clause H.10.2 for the profile and level specified in the bitstream when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex H, and it shall satisfy the constraints expressed in clause I.10.2 for the profile and level specified \nin the bitstream when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex I is \ndecoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I. \nC.4  Decoder conformance \nA decoder conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard fulfils the following requirements. \nA decoder claiming conformance to a specific profile and level shall be able to decode successfully all conforming \nbitstreams specified for decoder conformance in clause C.3, provided that all sequence parameter sets and picture \nparameter sets referred to in the VCL NAL units, and appropriate buffering period and picture timing SEI messages are \nconveyed to the decoder, in a timely manner, either in the bitstream (by non-VCL NAL units), or by external means not \nspecified by this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThere are two types of conformance that can be claimed by a decoder: output timing conformance and output order \nconformance. \nTo check conformance of a decoder, test bitstreams conforming to the claimed profile and level, as specified in clause C.3 \nare delivered by a hypothetical stream scheduler (HSS) both to the HRD and to the decoder under test (DUT). All pictures \noutput by the HRD shall also be output by the DUT and, for each picture output by the HRD, the values of all samples that \nare output by the DUT for the corresponding picture shall be equal to the values of the samples output by the HRD. \n \n\nFor output timing decoder conformance, the HSS operates as described above, with delivery schedules selected only from \nthe subset of values of SchedSelIdx for which the bit rate and CPB size are restricted as specified in Annex A, Annex G, \nAnnex H, and Annex I for the specified profile and level, or with \"interpolated\" delivery schedules as specified below for \nwhich the bit rate and CPB size are restricted as specified in Annex A, Annex G, Annex H, and Annex I. The same delivery \nschedule is used for both the HRD and DUT. \nWhen the HRD parameters and the buffering period SEI messages are present with cpb_cnt_minus1 greater than 0, the \ndecoder shall be capable of decoding the bitstream as delivered from the HSS operating using an \"interpolated\" delivery \nschedule specified as having peak bit rate r, CPB size c( r ), and initial CPB removal delay ( f( r ) \u00f7 r ) as follows: \n\uf061 = ( r \u2212 BitRate[ SchedSelIdx \u2212 1 ] ) \u00f7 ( BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] \u2212 BitRate[ SchedSelIdx \u2212 1 ] ),  (C-17) \nc( r ) = \uf061 * CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] + (1 \u2212 \uf061\uf029 * CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx\u22121 ],  (C-18) \nf( r ) = \uf061\uf020\uf02a\uf020initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] * BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] +  \n   ( 1 \u2212 \uf061 \uf029\uf020\uf02a\uf020initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx \u2212 1 ] * BitRate[ SchedSelIdx \u2212 1 ]  (C-19) \nfor any SchedSelIdx > 0 and r such that BitRate[ SchedSelIdx \u2212 1 ] <= r <= BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] such that r and c( r ) \nare within the limits as specified in Annex A, Annex G, Annex H, and Annex I for the maximum bit rate and buffer size \nfor the specified profile and level. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] can be different from one buffering period to another and have to be \nre-calculated. \nFor output timing decoder conformance, an HRD as described above is used and the timing (relative to the delivery time \nof the first bit) of picture output is the same for both HRD and the DUT up to a fixed delay. \nFor output order decoder conformance, the HSS delivers the bitstream to the DUT \"by demand\" from the DUT, meaning \nthat the HSS delivers bits (in decoding order) only when the DUT requires more bits to proceed with its processing. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 This means that for this test, the coded picture buffer of the DUT could be as small as the size of the largest access unit. \nA modified HRD as described below is used, and the HSS delivers the bitstream to the HRD by one of the schedules \nspecified in the bitstream such that the bit rate and CPB size are restricted as specified in Annex A, Annex G, Annex H, \nand Annex I. The order of pictures output shall be the same for both HRD and the DUT. \nFor output order decoder conformance, the HRD CPB size is equal to CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] for the selected schedule \nand the DPB size is equal to MaxDpbFrames. Removal time from the CPB for the HRD is equal to final bit arrival time \nand decoding is immediate. The operation of the DPB of this HRD is specified in clause C.4.1. \nC.4.1  Operation of the output order DPB \nThe decoded picture buffer contains frame buffers. When a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex A is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, each of the frame buffers \nmay contain a decoded frame, a decoded complementary field pair or a single (non-paired) decoded field that is marked as \n\"used for reference\" or is held for future output (reordered pictures). When a coded video sequence conforming to one or \nmore of the profiles specified in Annex G is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex G, each frame \nbuffer may contain a decoded frame, a decoded complementary field pair, a single (non-paired) decoded field, a decoded \nreference base frame, a decoded reference base complementary field pair or a single (non-paired) decoded reference base \nfield that is marked as \"used for reference\" (reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed pictures). \nWhen a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the \ndecoding process specified in Annex H, each of the frame buffers may contain a decoded frame view component, a decoded \ncomplementary field view component pair, or a single (non-paired) decoded field view component that is marked as \"used \nfor reference\" (reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed pictures) or is held for inter-view \nprediction (inter-view only reference components). When a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex I is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I, each of the frame buffers of the \ntexture DPB may contain a decoded texture frame view component, a decoded complementary texture field view \ncomponent pair, a single (non-paired) decoded texture field view component that is marked as \"used for reference\" \n(reference pictures) or is held for future output (reordered or delayed pictures) or is held for inter-view prediction (inter-\nview only reference components). When a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex I is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I, each of the frame buffers of the depth DPB \nmay contain a decoded depth frame view component, a decoded complementary depth field view component pair, or a \nsingle (non-paired) decoded depth field view component that is marked as \"used for reference\" (reference pictures) or is \nheld for future output (reordered or delayed pictures) or is held as reference for inter-view prediction (inter-view only \nreference components). \nAt HRD initialization, the DPB fullness, measured in non-empty frame buffers, is set equal to 0. The following steps all \nhappen instantaneously when an access unit is removed from the CPB, and in the order listed. When the decoding process \n \n\nspecified in Annex H or Annex I is applied, the view components of the current primary coded picture are processed by \napplying the ordered steps to each view component in increasing order of the associated view order index VOIdx. The \ninvocation of the process for a depth view component, if present, follows the invocation of the process for the texture view \ncomponent within the same view component. \n1.  The process of decoding gaps in frame_num and storing \"non-existing\" frames as specified in clause C.4.2 is \ninvoked. \n2.  The picture decoding and output process as specified in clause C.4.3 is invoked. \n3.  The process of removing pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture as specified in \nclause C.4.4 is invoked. \n4.  The process of marking and storing the current decoded picture as specified in clause C.4.5 is invoked. \nNOTE \u2013 When the decoding process specified in Annex G is applied, the DPB is only operated for decoded pictures and \nreference base pictures associated with decoded pictures. The DPB is not operated for layer pictures with dependency_id less \nthan DependencyIdMax (and associated reference base pictures). All decoded pictures and associated reference base pictures are \ndecoded pictures and associated reference base pictures for dependency_id equal to DependencyIdMax, which represent the \nresults of the decoding process specified in clause G.8. \nC.4.2  Decoding of gaps in frame_num and storage of \"non-existing\" pictures \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame \nview component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". During the invocation of the process for a \nparticular view, only view components of the particular view are considered and view components of other views are not \nmarked as \"unused for reference\" or removed from the DPB. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, the process specified in this clause for Annex H is invoked for \nparticular texture view and depth view with view order index VOIdx, with each \"view component\" being replaced by \n\"texture view component\" or \"depth view component\", \"frame view component\" being replaced by \"texture frame view \ncomponent\" or \"depth frame view component\", and \"field view component\" being replaced by \"texture field view \ncomponent\". During the invocation of the process for a particular texture view, only the texture view components of the \nparticular view are considered and during the invocation of the process for a particular depth view, only the depth view \ncomponents of the particular view are considered and view components of other views are not marked as \"unused for \nreference\" or removed from the DPB. \nThe DPB fullness represents the total number of non-empty frame buffers. When the decoding process specified in \nAnnex H is applied, this includes frame buffers that contain view components of other views. When the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I is applied, this includes frame buffers that contain texture or depth view components of other views. \nWhen applicable, gaps in frame_num are detected by the decoding process and the necessary number of \"non-existing\" \nframes are inferred in the order specified by the generation of values of UnusedShortTermFrameNum in Equation 7-24 \nand are marked as specified in clauses 8.2.5.2 and G.8.2.5. Frame buffers containing a frame or a complementary field pair \nor a non-paired field which are marked as \"not needed for output\" and \"unused for reference\" are emptied (without output), \nand the DPB fullness is decremented by the number of frame buffers emptied. Each \"non-existing\" frame is stored in the \nDPB as follows: \n\u2013  When there is no empty frame buffer (i.e., DPB fullness is equal to DPB size), the \"bumping\" process specified in \nclause C.4.5.3 is invoked repeatedly until there is an empty frame buffer in which to store the \"non-existing\" frame. \n\u2013  The \"non-existing\" frame is stored in an empty frame buffer and is marked as \"not needed for output\", and the DPB \nfullness is incremented by one. \nC.4.3  Picture decoding \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, the process specified for Annex H in this clause is invoked for \na particular texture view and depth view with view order index VOIdx. \nThe decoding of the current picture or view component (when applying the decoding process specified in Annex H or \nAnnex I) is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the decoding process specified in clause 8 or Annex G is applied, the current primary coded picture n is decoded \nand is temporarily stored (not in the DPB). \n\u2013  Otherwise (the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied), the view component with view order \nindex VOIdx of the current primary coded picture n is decoded and is temporarily stored (not in the DPB). \n \n\nC.4.4  Removal of pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H is applied, the process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular \nview with view order index VOIdx, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame \nview component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex I is applied, the process specified in this clause for Annex H is invoked for \nparticular texture view and depth view with view order index VOIdx, with each \"view component\" being replaced by \n\"texture view component\" or \"depth view component\", \"frame view component\" being replaced by \"texture frame view \ncomponent\" or \"depth frame view component\", and \"field view component\" being replaced by \"texture field view \ncomponent\". During the invocation of the process for a particular texture view, only the texture view components of the \nparticular view are considered and during the invocation of the process for a particular depth view, only the depth view \ncomponents of the particular view are considered. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied, the following process is specified for emptying \nframe buffers containing inter-view only reference components of the current access unit. By this process, frame buffers \nthat contain view components of the current view with view order index VOIdx are not emptied, but frame buffers that \ncontain inter-view only reference components of other views may be emptied. The process is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the view order index VOIdx of the current view is equal to VOIdxMax, all frame buffers containing a frame or a \ncomplementary field pair or a non-paired field which are marked as \"not needed for output\" and \"unused for reference\" \nare emptied (without output), and the DPB fullness is decremented by the number of frame buffers emptied. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 At this stage of the process, all frame buffers that contain a frame or a complementary field pair or a \nnon-paired field marked as \"not needed for output\" and \"unused for reference\" are frame buffers that contain an inter-\nview only reference component (of the current access unit and a view with view order index less than VOIdx) with \nOutputFlag equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the view order index VOIdx of the current view is less than VOIdxMax), frame buffers containing a frame \nor a complementary field pair or a non-paired field for which both of the following conditions are true are emptied \n(without output), and the DPB fullness is decremented by the number of frame buffers emptied: \n\u2013  the frame or complementary field pair or non-paired field is marked as \"not needed for output\" and \"unused for \nreference\", \nNOTE 2 \u2013 At this stage of the process, all frame buffers that contain a frame or a complementary field pair or a \nnon-paired field marked as \"not needed for output\" and \"unused for reference\" are frame buffers that contain an inter-\nview only reference component (of the current access unit and a view with view order index less than VOIdx) with \nOutputFlag equal to 0. \n\u2013  one of the following conditions is true: \n\u2013  the current view component is a view component of an anchor picture and the view_id of the frame or \ncomplementary field pair or non-paired field is not equal to any value of anchor_ref_lX[ k ][ j ], with X \nbeing equal to 0 or 1, k being any integer value greater than the view order index VOIdx of the current view, \nand j being any integer value in the range of 0 to Max( 0, num_anchor_refs_lX[ k ] \u2212 1 ), inclusive, \n\u2013  the current view component is not a view component of an anchor picture and the view_id of the frame or \ncomplementary field pair or non-paired field is not equal to any value of non_anchor_ref_lX[ k ][ j ], with \nX being equal to 0 or 1, k being any integer value greater than the view order index VOIdx of the current \nview, and j being any integer value in the range of 0 to Max( 0, num_non_anchor_refs_lX[ k ] \u2212 1 ), \ninclusive. \nWhen the decoding process specified in Annex H or Annex I is applied, for the following processes specified in this clause, \nonly view components of the particular view for which this clause is invoked are considered, and frame buffers containing \nview components of other views are not emptied. The DPB fullness represents the total number of non-empty frame buffers, \nincluding frame buffers that contain view components of other views. \nThe removal of pictures from the DPB before possible insertion of the current picture proceeds as follows: \n\u2013  If the decoded picture is an IDR picture the following applies: \n1.  All reference pictures in the DPB are marked as \"unused for reference\" as specified in clause 8.2.5 when a \ncoded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A is decoded by applying \nthe decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9, or as specified in clause G.8.2.4 when a coded video sequence \nconforming to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex G is decoded by applying the decoding process \nspecified in Annex G, or as specified in clause H.8.3 when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more \nof the profiles specified in Annex H is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex H, or as \nspecified in clause I.8.3 when a coded video sequence conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in \nAnnex I is decoded by applying the decoding process specified in Annex I. \n \n\n2.

When the decoding process \nspecified in Annex I is applied, this includes frame buffers that contain texture or depth view components of other views. \nThe \"bumping\" process is invoked in the following cases. \n\u2013  There is no empty frame buffer (i.e., DPB fullness is equal to DPB size) and an empty frame buffer is needed for \nstorage of an inferred \"non-existing\" frame, as specified in clause C.4.2. \n\u2013  The current picture is an IDR picture and no_output_of_prior_pics_flag is not equal to 1 and is not inferred to be \nequal to 1, as specified in clause C.4.4. \n\u2013  The current picture has memory_management_control_operation equal to 5, as specified in clause C.4.4. \n\u2013  There is no empty frame buffer (i.e., DPB fullness is equal to DPB size) and an empty frame buffer is needed for \nstorage of a decoded (non-IDR) reference picture or a reference base picture, as specified in clause C.4.5.1. \n\u2013  There is no empty frame buffer (i.e., DPB fullness is equal to DPB size) and the current picture is a non-reference \npicture that is not the second field of a complementary non-reference field pair and the current picture has OutputFlag \nequal to 1 and there are pictures in the DPB that are marked as \"needed for output\" that precede the current non-\nreference picture in output order, as specified in clause C.4.5.2, so an empty buffer is needed for storage of the current \npicture. \n\u2013  There is no empty frame buffer (i.e., DPB fullness is equal to DPB size) and the current picture is a non-reference \npicture that is not the second field of a complementary non-reference field pair and the current picture has \nStoreInterViewOnlyRefFlag equal to 1, as specified in clause C.4.5.2, so an empty buffer is needed for storage of the \ncurrent picture. \nThe \"bumping\" process consists of the following ordered steps: \n1.  The picture or complementary reference field pair that is considered first for output is selected as follows: \na.  The frame buffer is selected that contains the picture having the smallest value of PicOrderCnt( ) of all \npictures in the DPB marked as \"needed for output\". \nb.  Depending on the frame buffer, the following applies: \n\u2013  If this frame buffer contains a complementary non-reference field pair with both fields marked as \n\"needed for output\" and both fields have the same PicOrderCnt( ), the first of these two fields in \ndecoding order is considered first for output. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if this frame buffer contains a complementary reference field pair with both fields marked \nas \"needed for output\" and both fields have the same PicOrderCnt( ), the entire complementary reference \nfield pair is considered first for output. \nNOTE \u2013 When the two fields of a complementary reference field pair have the same value of PicOrderCnt( ), this \n\"bumping\" process will output these pictures together, although the two fields have different output times from a \ndecoder that satisfies output timing conformance criteria (as specified in clause C.2.2). \n\u2013  Otherwise, the picture in this frame buffer that has the smallest value of PicOrderCnt( ) is considered \nfirst for output. \n \n\n2.  Depending on whether a single picture or a complementary reference field pair is considered for output, the \nfollowing applies: \n\u2013  If a single picture is considered first for output, this picture is cropped, using the cropping rectangle specified \nin the active sequence parameter set for the picture, the cropped picture is output, and the picture is marked as \n\"not needed for output\". \n\u2013  Otherwise (a complementary reference field pair is considered first for output), the two fields of the \ncomplementary reference field pair are both cropped, using the cropping rectangle specified in the active \nsequence parameter set for the pictures, the two fields of the complementary reference field pair are output \ntogether, and both fields of the complementary reference field pair are marked as \"not needed for output\". \n3.  When there is a single depth view component or a complementary depth view component pair having the same \nvalues of view_id and PicOrderCnt( ) as the single picture or complementary reference field pair considered for \noutput, the single depth view component or complementary depth view component pair are output as in step 2. \n4.  The frame buffer that included the picture or complementary reference field pair that was cropped and output is \nchecked, and when any of the following conditions are true, the frame buffer is emptied and the DPB fullness is \ndecremented by 1: \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a non-reference non-paired field. \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a non-reference frame. \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a complementary non-reference field pair with both fields marked as \"not needed \nfor output\". \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a non-paired reference field marked as \"unused for reference\". \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a reference frame with both fields marked as \"unused for reference\". \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a complementary reference field pair with both fields marked as \"unused for \nreference\" and \"not needed for output\". \n \n\nAnnex D \n \nSupplemental enhancement information \n \n(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.) \nThis annex specifies syntax and semantics for SEI message payloads. \nSEI messages assist in processes related to decoding, display or other purposes. However, SEI messages are not required \nfor constructing the luma or chroma samples by the decoding process. Conforming decoders are not required to process \nthis information for output order conformance to this Recommendation | International Standard (see Annex C for the \nspecification of conformance). Some SEI message information is required to check bitstream conformance and for output \ntiming decoder conformance. \nIn Annex D, specification for presence of SEI messages are also satisfied when those messages (or some subset of them) \nare conveyed to decoders (or to the HRD) by other means not specified by this Recommendation | International Standard. \nWhen present in the bitstream, SEI messages shall obey the syntax and semantics specified in clauses 7.3.2.3 and 7.4.2.3 \nand this annex. When the content of an SEI message is conveyed for the application by some means other than presence \nwithin the bitstream, the representation of the content of the SEI message is not required to use the same syntax specified \nin this annex. For the purpose of counting bits, only the appropriate bits that are actually present in the bitstream are \ncounted. \nD.1  SEI payload syntax \nD.1.1  General SEI message syntax \n \nsei_payload(

Applications should be cautious of potential \u201ccollisions\u201d of the \ninterpretation for values of these syntax elements belonging to the first set of value ranges. Since different applications \nmight use these IDs having values in the first set of value ranges for different purposes, particular care should be exercised \nin the design of encoders that generate SEI messages with these IDs having values in the first set of value ranges, and in \nthe design of decoders that interpret SEI messages with these IDs. This Specification does not define any management for \nthese values. These IDs having values in the first set of value ranges might only be suitable for use in contexts in which \n\"collisions\" of usage (i.e., different definitions of the syntax and semantics of an SEI message with one of these IDs having \nthe same value in the first set of value ranges) are unimportant, or not possible, or are managed \u2013 e.g., defined or managed \nin the controlling application or transport specification, or by controlling the environment in which bitstreams are \ndistributed. \nD.2.2  Buffering period SEI message semantics \nThe presence of the buffering period SEI message in the bitstream is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If NalHrdBpPresentFlag is equal to 1 or VclHrdBpPresentFlag is equal to 1, one buffering period SEI message can \nbe present in any access unit of the bitstream, and one buffering period SEI message shall be present in every IDR \naccess unit and every access unit associated with a recovery point SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise (NalHrdBpPresentFlag is equal to 0 and VclHrdBpPresentFlag is equal to 0), no buffering period SEI \nmessages shall be present in any access unit of the bitstream. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 For some applications, the frequent presence of a buffering period SEI message may be desirable. \nA buffering period is specified as the set of access units between two instances of the buffering period SEI message in \ndecoding order. \nseq_parameter_set_id specifies the sequence parameter set  for the current coded video sequence. The value of \nseq_parameter_set_id shall be equal to the value of seq_parameter_set_id in the picture parameter set referenced by the \nprimary coded picture associated with the buffering period SEI message. The value of seq_parameter_set_id shall be in \nthe range of 0 to 31, inclusive. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When the sequence parameter set identified by seq_parameter_set_id is not already active, the buffering SEI message \nwill activate the identified sequence parameter set for the current coded video sequence as specified in clause 7.4.1.2.1. \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] specifies the delay for the SchedSelIdx-th CPB between the time of arrival in \nthe CPB of the first bit of the coded data associated with the access unit associated with the buffering period SEI message \nand the time of removal from the CPB of the coded data associated with the same access unit, for the first buffering period \nafter HRD initialization. The syntax element has a length in bits given by initial_cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1 + 1. \nIt is in units of a 90 kHz clock. initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ] shall not be equal to 0 and shall not exceed \n90000 * ( CpbSize[ SchedSelIdx ] \u00f7 BitRate[ SchedSelIdx ] ), the time-equivalent of the CPB size in 90 kHz clock units. \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[  SchedSelIdx  ]  is  used  for  the  SchedSelIdx-th  CPB  in  combination  with  the \ncpb_removal_delay  to  specify  the  initial  delivery  time  of  coded  access  units  to  the  CPB. \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[ SchedSelIdx ]  is  in  units  of  a  90  kHz  clock.  The \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[ SchedSelIdx ] syntax element is a fixed length code having a length in bits given by \n \n\ninitial_cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1 + 1. This syntax element is not used by decoders and is needed only for the \ndelivery scheduler (HSS) specified in Annex C. \nOver  the  entire  coded  video  sequence,  the  sum  of  initial_cpb_removal_delay[ SchedSelIdx ]  and \ninitial_cpb_removal_delay_offset[ SchedSelIdx ] shall be constant for each value of SchedSelIdx. \nD.2.3  Picture timing SEI message semantics \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The syntax of the picture timing SEI message is dependent on the content of the sequence parameter set that is active for \nthe primary coded picture associated with the picture timing SEI message. However, unless the picture timing SEI message of an \nIDR access unit is preceded by a buffering period SEI message within the same access unit, the activation of the associated sequence \nparameter set (and, for IDR pictures that are not the first picture in the bitstream, the determination that the primary coded picture is \nan IDR picture) does not occur until the decoding of the first coded slice NAL unit of the primary coded picture. Since the coded \nslice NAL unit of the primary coded picture follows the picture timing SEI message in NAL unit order, there may be cases in which \nit is necessary for a decoder to store the RBSP containing the picture timing SEI message until determining the parameters of the \nsequence parameter that will be active for the primary coded picture, and then perform the parsing of the picture timing SEI message. \nThe presence of the picture timing SEI message in the bitstream is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If CpbDpbDelaysPresentFlag is equal to 1 or pic_struct_present_flag is equal to 1, one picture timing SEI message \nshall be present in every access unit of the coded video sequence. \n\u2013  Otherwise (CpbDpbDelaysPresentFlag is equal to 0 and pic_struct_present_flag is equal to 0), no picture timing SEI \nmessages shall be present in any access unit of the coded video sequence. \ncpb_removal_delay specifies how many clock ticks (see clause E.2.1) to wait after removal from the CPB of the access \nunit associated with the most recent buffering period SEI message in a preceding access unit before removing from the \nbuffer the access unit data associated with the picture timing SEI message. This value is also used to calculate an earliest \npossible time of arrival of access unit data into the CPB for the HSS, as specified in Annex C. The syntax element is a \nfixed length code having a length in bits given by cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1 + 1. The cpb_removal_delay is the \nremainder of a modulo 2(cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1 + 1) counter. \nNOTE 2  \u2013  The  value  of  cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1  that  determines  the  length  (in  bits)  of  the  syntax  element \ncpb_removal_delay is the value of cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1 coded in the sequence parameter set that is active for the \nprimary coded picture associated with the picture timing SEI message, although cpb_removal_delay specifies a number of clock \nticks relative to the removal time of the preceding access unit containing a buffering period SEI message, which may be an access \nunit of a different coded video sequence. \ndpb_output_delay is used to compute the DPB output time of the picture. It specifies how many clock ticks to wait after \nremoval of an access unit from the CPB before the decoded picture can be output from the DPB (see clause C.2). \nNOTE 3 \u2013 A picture is not removed from the DPB at its output time when it is still marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \n\"used for long-term reference\". \nNOTE 4 \u2013 Only one dpb_output_delay is specified for a decoded picture. \nThe length of the syntax element dpb_output_delay is given in bits by dpb_output_delay_length_minus1 + 1. When \nmax_dec_frame_buffering is equal to 0, dpb_output_delay shall be equal to 0. \nThe output time derived from the dpb_output_delay of any picture that is output from an output timing conforming decoder \nas specified in clause C.2 shall precede the output time derived from the dpb_output_delay of all pictures in any subsequent \ncoded video sequence in decoding order. \nThe output time derived from the dpb_output_delay of  the second field, in decoding order, of a complementary \nnon-reference field pair shall exceed the output time derived from the dpb_output_delay of the first field of the same \ncomplementary non-reference field pair. \nThe picture output order established by the values of this syntax element shall be the same order as established by the \nvalues of PicOrderCnt( ) as specified in clauses C.4.1 to C.4.5, except that when the two fields of a complementary \nreference field pair have the same value of PicOrderCnt( ), the two fields have different output times. \nFor pictures that are not output by the \"bumping\" process of clause C.4.5 because they precede, in decoding order, an IDR \npicture with no_output_of_prior_pics_flag equal to 1 or inferred to be equal to 1, the output times derived from \ndpb_output_delay shall be increasing with increasing value of PicOrderCnt( ) relative to all pictures within the same coded \nvideo sequence subsequent to any picture having a memory_management_control_operation equal to 5. \npic_struct indicates whether a picture should be displayed as a frame or one or more fields, according to Table D-1. Frame \ndoubling (pic_struct equal to 7) indicates that the frame should be displayed two times consecutively, and frame tripling \n(pic_struct equal to 8) indicates that the frame should be displayed three times consecutively. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 Frame doubling can facilitate the display, for example, of 25p video on a 50p display and 29.97p video on a 59.94p \ndisplay. Using frame doubling and frame tripling in combination on every other frame can facilitate the display of 23.98p video on \na 59.94p display. \n \n\nWhen pic_struct is present (pic_struct_present_flag is equal to 1), the constraints specified in the third column of Table D-1 \nshall be obeyed. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 When pic_struct_present_flag is equal to 0, then in many cases default values may be inferred. In the absence of other \nindications of the intended display type of a picture, the decoder should infer the value of pic_struct as follows: \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 1, pic_struct should be inferred to be equal to (1 + bottom_field_flag). \n\u2013  Otherwise, if TopFieldOrderCnt is equal to BottomFieldOrderCnt, pic_struct should be inferred to be equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if TopFieldOrderCnt is less than BottomFieldOrderCnt, pic_struct should be inferred to be equal to 3. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 0 and TopFieldOrderCnt is greater than BottomFieldOrderCnt), pic_struct should be \ninferred to be equal to 4. \npic_struct is only a hint as to how the decoded video should be displayed on an assumed display type (e.g., interlaced or progressive) \nat an assumed display rate. When another display type or display rate is used by the decoder, then pic_struct does not indicate the \ndisplay method, but may aid in processing the decoded video for the alternative display. When it is desired for pic_struct to have an \neffective value in the range of 5 to 8, inclusive, pic_struct_present_flag should be equal to 1, as the above inference rule will not \nproduce these values. \nTable D-1 \u2013 Interpretation of pic_struct \n \nValue  Indicated display of picture  Restrictions  NumClockTS \n0  (progressive) frame  field_pic_flag shall be 0,  1 \nTopFieldOrderCnt shall be equal to \nBottomFieldOrderCnt \n1  top field  field_pic_flag shall be 1,  1 \nbottom_field_flag shall be 0 \n2  bottom field  field_pic_flag shall be 1,  1 \nbottom_field_flag shall be 1 \n3  top field, bottom field, in that order  field_pic_flag shall be 0,  2 \nTopFieldOrderCnt shall be less than or \nequal to BottomFieldOrderCnt \n4  bottom field, top field, in that order  field_pic_flag shall be 0,  2 \nBottomFieldOrderCnt shall be less than \nor equal to TopFieldOrderCnt \n5  top field, bottom field, top field repeated,  field_pic_flag shall be 0,  3 \nin that order  TopFieldOrderCnt shall be less than or \nequal to BottomFieldOrderCnt \n6  bottom  field,  top  field,  bottom  field  field_pic_flag shall be 0,  3 \nrepeated, in that order  BottomFieldOrderCnt shall be less than \nor equal to TopFieldOrderCnt \n7  frame doubling   field_pic_flag shall be 0,  2  \nfixed_frame_rate_flag shall be 1, \nTopFieldOrderCnt shall be equal to \nBottomFieldOrderCnt \n8  frame tripling   field_pic_flag shall be 0,  3  \nfixed_frame_rate_flag shall be 1, \nTopFieldOrderCnt shall be equal to \nBottomFieldOrderCnt \n9..15  reserved     \n \nWhen fixed_frame_rate_flag is equal to 1, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the constraints specified as \nfollows shall be obeyed throughout the operation of the following process, which is operated in output order. \n1.  Prior to output of the first picture of the bitstream (in output order) and prior to the output of the first picture (in \noutput order) of each subsequent coded video sequence for which the content of the active sequence parameter set \ndiffers from that of the previously-active sequence parameter set, the variable lastFieldBottom is set equal to \"not \ndetermined\". \n \n\n2.  After the output of each picture, the value of lastFieldBottom is checked and set as follows, using the values of \nfield_pic_flag, bottom_field_flag, pic_struct, TopFieldOrderCnt and BottomFieldOrderCnt (when applicable) for \nthe picture that was output. \n\u2013  If field_pic_flag is equal to 1, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the value of lastFieldBottom \nshall not be equal to bottom_field_flag. The value of lastFieldBottom is then set equal to bottom_field_flag. \n\u2013  Otherwise (field_pic_flag is equal to 0), the following applies: \n\u2013  If pic_struct is present and is equal to 3 or 5, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the value \nof lastFieldBottom shall  not be equal to 0. The value  of lastFieldBottom is then set equal to \n1 \u2212 ( ( pic_struct \u2212 1 ) >> 2 ). \n\u2013  Otherwise, if pic_struct is present and is equal to 4 or 6, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance \nthat the value of lastFieldBottom shall not be equal to 1. The value of lastFieldBottom is then set equal \nto ( ( pic_struct \u2212 1 ) >> 2 ). \n\u2013  Otherwise, if TopFieldOrderCnt is less than BottomFieldOrderCnt, it is a requirement of bitstream \nconformance that the value of lastFieldBottom shall not be equal to 0.  The value of lastFieldBottom is \nthen set equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if TopFieldOrderCnt is greater than BottomFieldOrderCnt, it is a requirement of bitstream \nconformance that the value of lastFieldBottom shall not be equal to 1. The value of lastFieldBottom is \nthen set equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (TopFieldOrderCnt is equal to BottomFieldOrderCnt and pic_struct is not present or is not \nin the range of 3 to 6, inclusive), lastFieldBottom may have any value, and its value is not changed. \nNumClockTS is determined by pic_struct as specified in Table D-1. There are up to NumClockTS sets of clock timestamp \ninformation for a picture, as specified by clock_timestamp_flag[ i ] for each set. The sets of clock timestamp information \napply to the field(s) or the frame(s) associated with the picture by pic_struct. \nThe contents of the clock timestamp syntax elements indicate a time of origin, capture, or alternative ideal display. This \nindicated time is computed as \nclockTimestamp = ( ( hH * 60 + mM ) * 60 + sS ) * time_scale +  \n                    nFrames * ( num_units_in_tick * ( 1 + nuit_field_based_flag ) ) + tOffset,  (D-1) \nin units of clock ticks of a clock with clock frequency equal to time_scale Hz, relative to some unspecified point in time \nfor which clockTimestamp is equal to 0. Output order and DPB output timing are not affected by the value of \nclockTimestamp. When two or more frames with pic_struct equal to 0 are consecutive in output order and have equal \nvalues of clockTimestamp, the indication is that the frames represent the same content and that the last such frame in output \norder is the preferred representation. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 clockTimestamp time indications may aid display on devices with refresh rates other than those well-matched to DPB \noutput times. \nclock_timestamp_flag[ i ] equal to 1 indicates that a number of clock timestamp syntax elements are present and follow \nimmediately. clock_timestamp_flag[ i ] equal to 0 indicates that the associated clock timestamp syntax elements are not \npresent. When NumClockTS is greater than 1 and clock_timestamp_flag[ i ] is equal to 1 for more than one value of i, the \nvalue of clockTimestamp shall be non-decreasing with increasing value of i. \nct_type indicates the scan type (interlaced or progressive) of the source material as specified in Table D-2. \nTwo fields of a coded frame may have different values of ct_type. \nWhen clockTimestamp is equal for two fields of opposite parity that are consecutive in output order, both with ct_type \nequal to 0 (progressive) or ct_type equal to 2 (unknown), the two fields are indicated to have come from the same original \nprogressive frame. Two consecutive fields in output order shall have different values of clockTimestamp when the value \nof ct_type for either field is 1 (interlaced). \n \n\nTable D-2 \u2013 Mapping of ct_type to source picture scan \n \nOriginal  \nValue \npicture scan \n0  progressive \n1  interlaced \n2  unknown \n3  reserved \n \nnuit_field_based_flag is used in calculating clockTimestamp, as specified in Equation D-1. \ncounting_type specifies the method of dropping values of the n_frames as specified in Table D-3. \nTable D-3 \u2013 Definition of counting_type values \n \nValue  Interpretation \n0  no dropping of n_frames count values and no use of \ntime_offset \n1  no dropping of n_frames count values \n2  dropping of individual zero values of n_frames count \n3  dropping of individual MaxFPS \u2212 1 values of n_frames \ncount \n4  dropping of the two lowest (value 0 and 1) n_frames \ncounts  when  seconds_value  is  equal  to 0  and \nminutes_value is not an integer multiple of 10 \n5  dropping of unspecified individual n_frames count values \n6  dropping of unspecified numbers of unspecified n_frames \ncount values \n7..31  reserved \n \nfull_timestamp_flag equal to 1 specifies that the n_frames syntax element is followed by seconds_value, minutes_value, \nand hours_value. full_timestamp_flag equal to 0 specifies that the n_frames syntax element is followed by seconds_flag. \ndiscontinuity_flag equal to 0 indicates that the difference between the current value of clockTimestamp and the value of \nclockTimestamp computed from the previous clock timestamp in output order can be interpreted as the time difference \nbetween the times of origin or capture of the associated frames or fields. discontinuity_flag equal to 1 indicates that the \ndifference between the current value of clockTimestamp and the value of clockTimestamp computed from the previous \nclock timestamp in output order should not be interpreted as the time difference between the times of origin or capture of \nthe associated frames or fields. When discontinuity_flag is equal to 0, the value of clockTimestamp shall be greater than \nor equal to all values of clockTimestamp present for the preceding picture in DPB output order. \ncnt_dropped_flag specifies the skipping of one or more values of n_frames using the counting method specified by \ncounting_type. \nn_frames specifies the value of nFrames used to compute clockTimestamp. n_frames shall be less than \nMaxFPS = Ceil( time_scale \u00f7 ( 2 * num_units_in_tick ) )  (D-2) \nNOTE 8 \u2013 n_frames is a frame-based counter.

This counting method is well known in industry and is often \nreferred to as \"NTSC drop-frame\" counting. \nWhen counting_type is equal to 5 or 6 and cnt_dropped_flag is equal to 1, n_frames shall not be equal to 1 plus the value \nof n_frames for the previous picture in output order modulo MaxFPS unless discontinuity_flag is equal to 1. \nNOTE 12 \u2013 When counting_type is equal to 5 or 6, the need for increasingly large magnitudes of tOffset in Equation D-1 when \nusing fixed non-integer frame rates can be avoided by occasionally skipping over some values of n_frames when counting.

Values of pan_scan_rect_id from 256 to 511, inclusive, and from 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, are reserved for \nfuture use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of pan_scan_rect_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, \nor in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore it. \n \n\npan_scan_rect_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the SEI message cancels the persistence of any previous pan-scan \nrectangle SEI message in output order. pan_scan_rect_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that pan-scan rectangle information \nfollows. \npan_scan_cnt_minus1  specifies  the  number  of  pan-scan  rectangles  that  are  present  in  the  SEI  message. \npan_scan_cnt_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. pan_scan_cnt_minus1 equal to 0 indicates that a single \npan-scan rectangle is present that applies to all fields of the decoded picture. pan_scan_cnt_minus1 shall be equal to 0 \nwhen the current picture is a field. pan_scan_cnt_minus1 equal to 1 indicates that two pan-scan rectangles are present, the \nfirst of which applies to the first field of the picture in output order and the second of which applies to the second field of \nthe picture in output order. pan_scan_cnt_minus1 equal to 2 indicates that three pan-scan rectangles are present, the first \nof which applies to the first field of the picture in output order, the second of which applies to the second field of the picture \nin output order, and the third of which applies to a repetition of the first field as a third field in output order. \npan_scan_rect_left_offset[ i ],  pan_scan_rect_right_offset[ i ],  pan_scan_rect_top_offset[ i ],  and \npan_scan_rect_bottom_offset[ i ], specify, as signed integer quantities in units of one-sixteenth sample spacing relative \nto the luma sampling grid, the location of the pan-scan rectangle. The values of each of these four syntax elements shall \nbe in the range of \u2212231 + 1 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. \nThe pan-scan rectangle is specified, in units of one-sixteenth sample spacing relative to a luma frame sampling grid, as the \nregion with frame horizontal coordinates from 16*CropUnitX * frame_crop_left_offset + pan_scan_rect_left_offset[ i ] to \n16 * ( 16 * PicWidthInMbs \u2212 CropUnitX * frame_crop_right_offset ) +  pan_scan_rect_right_offset[ i ] \u2212 1  and  with \nvertical  coordinates  from  16 *CropUnitY * frame_crop_top_offset +  pan_scan_rect_top_offset[ i ]  to \n16 * ( 16 * PicHeightInMbs \u2212 CropUnitY * frame_crop_bottom_offset ) +  pan_scan_rect_bottom_offset[ i ] \u2212 1, \ninclusive. The value of 16 * CropUnitX * frame_crop_left_offset + pan_scan_rect_left_offset[ i ] shall be less than or \nequal to 16 * ( 16 * PicWidthInMbs \u2212 CropUnitX * frame_crop_right_offset ) + pan_scan_rect_right_offset[ i ] \u2212 1; and \nthe value of 16 * CropUnitY * frame_crop_top_offset + pan_scan_rect_top_offset[ i ] shall be less than or equal to \n16 * ( 16 * PicHeightInMbs \u2212 CropUnitY * frame_crop_bottom_offset ) + pan_scan_rect_bottom_offset[ i ] \u2212 1. \nWhen the pan-scan rectangular area includes samples outside of the cropping rectangle, the region outside of the cropping \nrectangle may be filled with synthesized content (such as black video content or neutral grey video content) for display. \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period specifies the persistence of the pan-scan rectangle SEI message and may specify a \npicture order count interval within which another pan-scan rectangle SEI message with the same value of pan_scan_rect_id \nor the end of the coded video sequence shall be present in the bitstream. The value of pan_scan_rect_repetition_period \nshall  be  in  the  range  of  0  to  16 384,  inclusive.  When  pan_scan_cnt_minus1  is  greater  than  0, \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period shall not be greater than 1. \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period equal to 0 specifies that the pan-scan rectangle information applies to the current decoded \npicture only. \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period equal to 1 specifies that the pan-scan rectangle information persists in output order until \nany of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a pan-scan rectangle SEI message with the same value of pan_scan_rect_id is \noutput having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ). \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period equal to 0 or equal to 1 indicates that another pan-scan rectangle SEI message with the \nsame value of pan_scan_rect_id may or may not be present. \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period greater than 1 specifies that the pan-scan rectangle information persists until any of the \nfollowing conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a pan-scan rectangle SEI message with the same value of pan_scan_rect_id is \noutput having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period. \npan_scan_rect_repetition_period greater than 1 indicates that another pan-scan rectangle SEI message with the same value \nof pan_scan_rect_id shall be present for a picture in an access unit that is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + pan_scan_rect_repetition_period; unless the \nbitstream ends or a new coded video sequence begins without output of such a picture. \nD.2.5  Filler payload SEI message semantics \nThis message contains a series of payloadSize bytes of value 0xFF, which can be discarded. \nff_byte shall be a byte having the value 0xFF. \n \n\nD.2.6  User data registered by Rec. ITU-T T.35 SEI message semantics \nThis message contains user data registered as specified by Rec. ITU-T T.35, the contents of which are not specified by this \nRecommendation | International Standard. \nitu_t_t35_country_code shall be a byte having a value specified as a country code by Rec. ITU-T T.35 Annex A. \nitu_t_t35_country_code_extension_byte shall be a byte having a value specified as a country code by Rec. ITU-T T.35 \nAnnex B. \nitu_t_t35_payload_byte shall be a byte containing data registered as specified by Rec. ITU-T T.35. \nThe ITU-T T.35 terminal provider code and terminal provider oriented code shall be contained in the first one or more \nbytes of the itu_t_t35_payload_byte, in the format specified by the Administration that issued the terminal provider code. \nAny remaining itu_t_t35_payload_byte data shall be data having syntax and semantics as specified by the entity identified \nby the ITU-T T.35 country code and terminal provider code. \nD.2.7  User data unregistered SEI message semantics \nThis message contains unregistered user data identified by a UUID, the contents of which are not specified by this \nRecommendation | International Standard. \nuuid_iso_iec_11578 shall have a value specified as a UUID according to the procedures of ISO/IEC 11578:1996 Annex A. \nuser_data_payload_byte shall be a byte containing data having syntax and semantics as specified by the UUID generator. \nD.2.8  Recovery point SEI message semantics \nThe recovery point SEI message assists a decoder in determining when the decoding process will produce acceptable \npictures for display after the decoder initiates random access or after the encoder indicates a broken link in the coded video \nsequence. When the decoding process is started with the access unit in decoding order associated with the recovery point \nSEI message, all decoded pictures at or subsequent to the recovery point in output order specified in this SEI message are \nindicated to be correct or approximately correct in content. Decoded pictures produced by random access at or before the \npicture associated with the recovery point SEI message need not be correct in content until the indicated recovery point, \nand the operation of the decoding process starting at the picture associated with the recovery point SEI message may \ncontain references to pictures not available in the decoded picture buffer. \nIn addition, by use of the broken_link_flag, the recovery point SEI message can indicate to the decoder the location of \nsome pictures in the bitstream that can result in serious visual artefacts when displayed, even when the decoding process \nwas begun at the location of a previous IDR access unit in decoding order. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The broken_link_flag can be used by encoders to indicate the location of a point after which the decoding process for the \ndecoding of some pictures may cause references to pictures that, though available for use in the decoding process, are not the pictures \nthat were used for reference when the bitstream was originally encoded (e.g., due to a splicing operation performed during the \ngeneration of the bitstream). \nThe recovery point is specified as a count in units of frame_num increments subsequent to the frame_num of the current \naccess unit at the position of the SEI message. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When HRD information is present in the bitstream, a buffering period SEI message should be associated with the access \nunit associated with the recovery point SEI message in order to establish initialization of the HRD buffer model after a random \naccess. \nAny picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by a picture associated with a recovery point SEI message or by any \npicture following such a picture in decoding order shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation, \nregardless of whether or not the decoding process is started at the beginning of the bitstream or with the access unit, in \ndecoding order, that is associated with the recovery point SEI message. \nAny sequence parameter set RBSP that is referred to by a picture associated with a recovery point SEI message or by any \npicture following such a picture in decoding order shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation, \nregardless of whether or not the decoding process is started at the beginning of the bitstream or with the access unit, in \ndecoding order, that is associated with the recovery point SEI message. \nrecovery_frame_cnt specifies the recovery point of output pictures in output order. All decoded pictures in output order \nare indicated to be correct or approximately correct in content starting at the output order position of the reference picture \nhaving the frame_num equal to the frame_num of the VCL NAL units for the current access unit incremented by \nrecovery_frame_cnt  in  modulo  MaxFrameNum  arithmetic.  recovery_frame_cnt  shall  be  in  the  range  of  0  to \nMaxFrameNum \u2212 1, inclusive. \nexact_match_flag indicates whether decoded pictures at and subsequent to the specified recovery point in output order \nderived by starting the decoding process at the access unit associated with the recovery point SEI message shall be an exact \nmatch to the pictures that would be produced by starting the decoding process at the location of a previous IDR access unit \n \n\nin the NAL unit stream. The value 0 indicates that the match need not be exact and the value 1 indicates that the match \nshall be exact. \nWhen decoding starts from the location of the recovery point SEI message, all references to not available reference pictures \nshall be inferred as references to pictures containing only macroblocks coded using Intra macroblock prediction modes \nand  having  sample  values  given  by  Y  samples  equal  to  ( 1 << ( BitDepth  \u2212 1 ) ),  Cb  samples  equal  to \nY\n( 1 << ( BitDepth  \u2212 1 ) ), and Cr samples equal to ( 1 << ( BitDepth  \u2212 1 ) ) (mid-level grey) for purposes of determining \nC C\nthe conformance of the value of exact_match_flag. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When performing random access, decoders should infer all references to not available reference pictures as references to \npictures containing only intra macroblocks and having sample values given by Y equal to ( 1 << ( BitDepthY \u2212 1 ) ), Cb equal to \n( 1 << ( BitDepthC \u2212 1 ) ), and Cr equal to ( 1 << ( BitDepthC \u2212 1 ) ) (mid-level grey), regardless of the value of exact_match_flag. \nWhen exact_match_flag is equal to 0, the quality of the approximation at the recovery point is chosen by the encoding \nprocess and is not specified by this Recommendation | International Standard. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 Under some circumstances, the decoding process of pictures depends on the difference DiffPicOrderCnt( picA, picB ) \nbetween the PicOrderCnt( ) values for two pictures picA and picB. However, no particular values of TopFieldOrderCnt and \nBottomFieldOrderCnt (as applicable) are specified to be assigned to the reference pictures that are not available due to the initiation \nof random access at the location of a picture associated with a recovery point SEI message. Also, no particular value has been \nspecified for initialization (for random access purposes) of the related variables prevPicOrderCntMsb, prevPicOrderCntLsb, \nprevFraneNumOffset, and prevFrameNum. Thus, any values for these variables may be assigned that could hypothetically have \nresulted from operation of the decoding process starting with a hypothetical preceding IDR picture in decoding order, although such \nvalues may not be the same as the values that would have been obtained if the decoding process had started with the actual preceding \nIDR picture in the bitstream. When performing random access at a picture associated with a recovery point SEI message, it is \nsuggested that decoders should derive the picture order count variables TopFieldOrderCnt and BottomFieldOrderCnt according to \nthe following method: \n\u2013  A bit range greater than 32 bits should be allocated for the variables TopFieldOrderCnt and BottomFieldOrderCnt for each \ncurrent picture to be decoded, as well as for the intermediate variables used for deriving these variables as specified in \nclause 8.2.1. (Due to the lack of assurance of correspondence of the values used for initialization of the related variables when \nrandom access is performed to the values that would be obtained if the decoding process had begun with the preceding IDR \npicture in decoding order, the calculations involving these variables in the decoding process of subsequent pictures may result \nin violation of the 32 bit range.) \n\u2013  Any value within in the range of \u2212231 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be assigned to the values of the variables TopFieldOrderCnt \nand BottomFieldOrderCnt of the reference pictures that are not available due to the random access operation. For example, the \nvalue 0 may be assigned to these variables. \n\u2013  For  the  derivation  of  the  picture  order  count  variables  for  the  picture  at  which  random  access  is  performed, \nprevPicOrderCntMsb may be set equal to any integer multiple of MaxPicOrderCntLsb in the range of \u2212231 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, \nprevPicOrderCntLsb  may  be  set  equal  to  any  value  in  the  range  of  0  to  MaxPicOrderCntLsb \u2212 1,  inclusive, \nprevFrameNumOffset may be set equal to any integer multiple of MaxFrameNum in the range of 0 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, and \nprevFrameNum may be set equal to any value in the range of 0 to MaxFrameNum \u2212 1, inclusive. For example, the value 0 may \nbe assigned to all of the variables prevPicOrderCntMsb, prevPicOrderCntLsb, prevFrameNumOffset, and prevFrameNum. \nWhen exact_match_flag is equal to 1, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the values of the samples in the \ndecoded pictures at or subsequent to the recovery point in output order shall be independent of the values that a decoder \nassigns to the variables prevPicOrderCntMsb, prevPicOrderCntLsb, prevFrameNumOffset, and prevFrameNum used in \nclause 8.2.1 for deriving the picture order count variables for the initialization of the decoding process at the picture \nassociated with the recovery point SEI message, and of the values that are assigned to the TopFieldOrderCnt and \nBottomFieldOrderCnt variables of the reference pictures that are not available due to the random access operation. \nbroken_link_flag indicates the presence or absence of a broken link in the NAL unit stream at the location of the recovery \npoint SEI message and is assigned further semantics as follows: \n\u2013  If broken_link_flag is equal to 1, pictures produced by starting the decoding process at the location of a previous IDR \naccess unit may contain undesirable visual artefacts to the extent that decoded pictures at and subsequent to the access \nunit associated with the recovery point SEI message in decoding order should not be displayed until the specified \nrecovery point in output order. \n\u2013  Otherwise (broken_link_flag is equal to 0), no indication is given regarding any potential presence of visual artefacts. \nRegardless of the value of the broken_link_flag, pictures subsequent to the specified recovery point in output order are \nspecified to be correct or approximately correct in content. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 When a sub-sequence information SEI message is present in conjunction with a recovery point SEI message in which \nbroken_link_flag is equal to 1 and when sub_seq_layer_num is equal to 0, sub_seq_id should be different from the latest sub_seq_id \nfor sub_seq_layer_num equal to 0 that was decoded prior to the location of the recovery point SEI message. When broken_link_flag \nis equal to 0, the sub_seq_id in sub-sequence layer 0 should remain unchanged. \nchanging_slice_group_idc equal to 0 indicates that decoded pictures are correct or approximately correct in content at \nand subsequent to the recovery point in output order when all macroblocks of the primary coded pictures are decoded \nwithin the changing slice group period, i.e., the period between the access unit associated with the recovery point SEI \nmessage (inclusive) and the specified recovery point (inclusive) in decoding order. changing_slice_group_idc shall be \n \n\nequal to 0 when num_slice_groups_minus1 is equal to 0 in any primary coded picture within the changing slice group \nperiod. \nWhen  changing_slice_group_idc  is  equal  to 1  or  2,  num_slice_groups_minus1  shall  be  equal  to 1  and  the \nmacroblock-to-slice-group map type 3, 4, or 5 shall be applied in each primary coded picture in the changing slice group \nperiod. \nchanging_slice_group_idc equal to 1 indicates that within the changing slice group period no sample values outside the \ndecoded macroblocks covered by slice group 0 are used for inter prediction of any macroblock within slice group 0. In \naddition, changing_slice_group_idc equal to 1 indicates that when all macroblocks in slice group 0 within the changing \nslice group period are decoded, decoded pictures will be correct or approximately correct in content at and subsequent to \nthe specified recovery point in output order regardless of whether any macroblock in slice group 1 within the changing \nslice group period is decoded. \nchanging_slice_group_idc equal to 2 indicates that within the changing slice group period no sample values outside the \ndecoded macroblocks covered by slice group 1 are used for inter prediction of any macroblock within slice group 1. In \naddition, changing_slice_group_idc equal to 2 indicates that when all macroblocks in slice group 1 within the changing \nslice group period are decoded, decoded pictures will be correct or approximately correct in content at and subsequent to \nthe specified recovery point in output order regardless of whether any macroblock in slice group 0 within the changing \nslice group period is decoded. \nchanging_slice_group_idc shall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. \nD.2.9  Decoded reference picture marking repetition SEI message semantics \nThe decoded reference picture marking repetition SEI message is used to repeat the decoded reference picture marking \nsyntax structure that was located in the slice headers of an earlier picture in the same coded video sequence in decoding \norder. \noriginal_idr_flag shall be equal to 1 when the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure occurred originally in \nan IDR picture. original_idr_flag shall be equal to 0 when the repeated decoded reference picture marking syntax structure \ndid not occur in an IDR picture originally. \noriginal_frame_num shall be equal to the frame_num of the picture where the repeated decoded reference picture marking \nsyntax structure originally occurred. The picture indicated by original_frame_num is the previous coded picture having the \nspecified  value  of  frame_num.  The  value  of  original_frame_num  used  to  refer  to  a  picture  having  a \nmemory_management_control_operation equal to 5 shall be 0. \noriginal_field_pic_flag shall be equal to the field_pic_flag of the picture where the repeated decoded reference picture \nmarking syntax structure originally occurred. \noriginal_bottom_field_flag shall be equal to the bottom_field_flag of the picture where the repeated decoded reference \npicture marking syntax structure originally occurred. \ndec_ref_pic_marking( ) shall contain a copy of the decoded reference picture marking syntax structure of the picture that \nhas a value of frame_num equal to original_frame_num. The IdrPicFlag used in the specification of the repeated \ndec_ref_pic_marking( ) syntax structure shall be the IdrPicFlag of the slice header(s) of the picture that has a value of \nframe_num  equal  to  original_frame_num  (i.e.,  IdrPicFlag  as  used  in  clause 7.3.3.3  shall  be  considered  equal  to \noriginal_idr_flag). \nD.2.10  Spare picture SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message indicates that certain slice group map units, called spare slice group map units, in one or more decoded \nreference pictures resemble the co-located slice group map units in a specified decoded picture called the target picture. A \nspare slice group map unit may be used to replace a co-located, incorrectly decoded slice group map unit, in the target \npicture. A decoded picture containing spare slice group map units is called a spare picture. \nA spare picture SEI message shall not be present in an IDR access unit. The value of the PicSizeInMapUnits variable for \nthe target picture (as specified later in this clause) shall be equal to the value of the PicSizeInMapUnits variable for the \nsequence parameter set that is active when processing the spare picture SEI message. \nFor all spare pictures identified in a spare picture SEI message, the value of frame_mbs_only_flag shall be equal to the \nvalue of frame_mbs_only_flag of the target picture in the same SEI message. The spare pictures in the SEI message are \nconstrained as follows: \n\u2013  If the target picture is a decoded field, all spare pictures identified in the same SEI message shall be decoded fields. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the target picture is a decoded frame), all spare pictures identified in the same SEI message shall be \ndecoded frames. \n \n\nFor  all  spare  pictures  identified  in  a  spare  picture  SEI  message,  the  values  of  pic_width_in_mbs_minus1  and \npic_height_in_map_units_minus1  shall  be  equal  to  the  values  of  pic_width_in_mbs_minus1  and \npic_height_in_map_units_minus1, respectively, of the target picture in the same SEI message. The picture associated (as \nspecified in clause 7.4.1.2.3) with this SEI message shall appear after the target picture, in decoding order. \ntarget_frame_num indicates the frame_num of the target picture. \nspare_field_flag equal to 0 indicates that the target picture and the spare pictures are decoded frames. spare_field_flag \nequal to 1 indicates that the target picture and the spare pictures are decoded fields. \ntarget_bottom_field_flag equal to 0 indicates that the target picture is a top field. target_bottom_field_flag equal to 1 \nindicates that the target picture is a bottom field. \nA target picture is a decoded reference picture for which the corresponding primary coded picture precedes the current \npicture, in decoding order, and in which the values of frame_num, field_pic_flag (when present) and bottom_field_flag \n(when present) are equal to target_frame_num, spare_field_flag and target_bottom_field_flag, respectively. \nnum_spare_pics_minus1 indicates the number of spare pictures for the specified target picture. The number of spare \npictures is equal to num_spare_pics_minus1 + 1. The value of num_spare_pics_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 15, \ninclusive. \ndelta_spare_frame_num[ i ] is used to identify the spare picture that contains the i-th set of spare slice group map units, \nhereafter called the i-th spare picture, as specified below. The value of delta_spare_frame_num[ i ] shall be in the range of \n0 to MaxFrameNum \u2212 2 + spare_field_flag, inclusive. \nThe frame_num of the i-th spare picture, spareFrameNum[ i ], is derived as follows for all values of i from 0 to \nnum_spare_pics_minus1, inclusive: \ncandidateSpareFrameNum = target_frame_num \u2212 1 + spare_field_flag \nfor ( i = 0; i  <=  num_spare_pics_minus1; i++ ) { \n  if( candidateSpareFrameNum < 0 )   \n    candidateSpareFrameNum = MaxFrameNum \u2212 1 \n  spareFrameNum[ i ] = candidateSpareFrameNum \u2212 delta_spare_frame_num[ i ]   (D-3) \n  if( spareFrameNum[ i ] < 0 ) \n    spareFrameNum[ i ] = MaxFrameNum + spareFrameNum[ i ] \n  candidateSpareFrameNum = spareFrameNum[ i ] \u2212 1 + spare_field_flag \n} \nspare_bottom_field_flag[ i ] equal to 0 indicates that the i-th spare picture is a top field. spare_bottom_field_flag[ i ] \nequal to 1 indicates that the i-th spare picture is a bottom field. \nThe 0-th spare picture is a decoded reference picture for which the corresponding primary coded picture precedes the target \npicture, in decoding order, and in which the values of frame_num, field_pic_flag (when present) and bottom_field_flag \n(when present) are equal to spareFrameNum[ 0 ], spare_field_flag and spare_bottom_field_flag[ 0 ], respectively. The i-th \nspare picture is a decoded reference picture for which the corresponding primary coded picture precedes the ( i \u2212 1 )-th \nspare  picture,  in  decoding  order,  and  in  which  the  values  of  frame_num,  field_pic_flag  (when  present)  and \nbottom_field_flag (when present) are equal to spareFrameNum[ i ], spare_field_flag and spare_bottom_field_flag[ i ], \nrespectively. \nspare_area_idc[ i ] indicates the method used to identify the spare slice group map units in the i-th spare picture. \nspare_area_idc[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. spare_area_idc[ i ] equal to 0 indicates that all slice group map \nunits in the i-th spare picture are spare units. spare_area_idc[ i ] equal to 1 indicates that the value of the syntax element \nspare_unit_flag[ i ][ j ] is used to identify the spare slice group map units. spare_area_idc[ i ] equal to 2 indicates that the \nzero_run_length[ i ][ j ] syntax element is used to derive the values of spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ], as described \nbelow. \nspare_unit_flag[ i ][ j ] equal to 0 indicates that the j-th slice group map unit in raster scan order in the i-th spare picture \nis a spare unit. spare_unit_flag[ i ][ j ] equal to 1 indicates that the j-th slice group map unit in raster scan order in the i-th \nspare picture is not a spare unit. \nzero_run_length[ i ][ j ] is used to derive the values of spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] when spare_area_idc[ i ] is \nequal to 2. In this case, the spare slice group map units identified in spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] appear in counter-\nclockwise box-out order, as specified in clause 8.2.2.4, for each spare picture. spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] equal \nto 0 indicates that the j-th slice group map unit in counter-clockwise box-out order in the i-th spare picture is a spare unit. \nspareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] equal to 1 indicates that the j-th slice group map unit in counter-clockwise box-out \norder in the i-th spare picture is not a spare unit. \n \n\nWhen spare_area_idc[ 0 ] is equal to 2, spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ 0 ][ j ] is derived as specified by the following \npseudo-code: \nfor( j = 0, loop = 0; j < PicSizeInMapUnits; loop++ ) { \n    for( k = 0; k < zero_run_length[ 0 ][ loop ]; k++ ) \n        spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ 0 ][ j++ ] = 0    (D-4) \n    spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ 0 ][ j++ ] = 1 \n} \nWhen spare_area_idc[ i ] is equal to 2 and the value of i is greater than 0, spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] is derived \nas specified by the following pseudo-code: \nfor( j = 0, loop = 0; j < PicSizeInMapUnits; loop++ ) { \n    for( k = 0; k < zero_run_length[ i ][ loop ]; k++ ) \n        spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] = spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i \u2212 1 ][ j++ ]   (D-5) \n    spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i ][ j ] = !spareUnitFlagInBoxOutOrder[ i \u2212 1 ][ j++ ] \n} \nD.2.11  Scene information SEI message semantics \nA scene and a scene transition are herein defined as a set of consecutive pictures in output order. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Decoded pictures within one scene generally have similar content. The scene information SEI message is used to label \npictures with scene identifiers and to indicate scene changes. The message specifies how the source pictures for the labelled pictures \nwere created. The decoder may use the information to select an appropriate algorithm to conceal transmission errors. For example, \na specific algorithm may be used to conceal transmission errors that occurred in pictures belonging to a gradual scene transition. \nFurthermore, the scene information SEI message may be used in a manner determined by the application, such as for indexing the \nscenes of a coded sequence. \nA scene information SEI message labels all pictures, in decoding order, from the primary coded picture to which the SEI \nmessage is associated (inclusive), as specified in clause 7.4.1.2.3, to the primary coded picture to which the next scene \ninformation SEI message (if present) in decoding order is associated (exclusive) or (otherwise) to the last access unit in \nthe bitstream (inclusive). These pictures are herein referred to as the target pictures. \nscene_info_present_flag equal to 0 indicates that the scene or scene transition to which the target pictures belong is \nunspecified. scene_info_present_flag equal to 1 indicates that the target pictures belong to the same scene or scene \ntransition. \nscene_id identifies the scene to which the target pictures belong. When the value of scene_transition_type of the target \npictures is less than 4, and the previous picture in output order is marked with a value of scene_transition_type less than 4, \nand the value of scene_id is the same as the value of scene_id of the previous picture in output order, this indicates that the \nsource scene for the target pictures and the source scene for the previous picture (in output order) are considered by the \nencoder to have been the same scene. When the value of scene_transition_type of the target pictures is greater than 3, and \nthe previous picture in output order is marked with a value of scene_transition_type less than 4, and the value of scene_id \nis the same as the value of scene_id of the previous picture in output order, this indicates that one of the source scenes for \nthe target pictures and the source scene for the previous picture (in output order) are considered by the encoder to have \nbeen the same scene. When the value of scene_id is not equal to the value of scene_id of the previous picture in output \norder, this indicates that the target pictures and the previous picture (in output order) are considered by the encoder to have \nbeen from different source scenes. \nThe value of scene_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of scene_id in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive, and in the range of 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as \ndetermined by the application. Values of scene_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, and in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, \ninclusive, are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of scene_id in the range of 256 \nto 511, inclusive, or in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and discard) it. \nscene_transition_type specifies in which type of a scene transition (if any) the target pictures are involved. The valid \nvalues of scene_transition_type are specified in Table D-4. \n \n\nTable D-4 \u2013 scene_transition_type values \n \nValue  Description \n0  No transition \n1  Fade to black \n2  Fade from black \n3  Unspecified transition from or to constant colour \n4  Dissolve \n5  Wipe \n6  Unspecified mixture of two scenes \n \nWhen scene_transition_type is greater than 3, the target pictures include contents both from the scene labelled by its \nscene_id and the next scene, in output order, which is labelled by second_scene_id (see below). The term \"the current \nscene\" is used to indicate the scene labelled by scene_id. The term \"the next scene\" is used to indicate the scene labelled \nby second_scene_id. It is not required for any following picture, in output order, to be labelled with scene_id equal to \nsecond_scene_id of the current SEI message. \nScene transition types are specified as follows. \n\"No transition\" specifies that the target pictures are not involved in a gradual scene transition. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When two consecutive pictures in output order have scene_transition_type equal to 0 and different values of scene_id, a \nscene cut occurred between the two pictures. \n\"Fade to black\" indicates that the target pictures are part of a sequence of pictures, in output order, involved in a fade to \nblack scene transition, i.e., the luma samples of the scene gradually approach zero and the chroma samples of the scene \ngradually approach 128. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When two pictures are labelled to belong to the same scene transition and their scene_transition_type is \"Fade to black\", \nthe later one, in output order, is darker than the previous one. \n\"Fade from black\" indicates that the target pictures are part of a sequence of pictures, in output order, involved in a fade \nfrom black scene transition, i.e., the luma samples of the scene gradually diverge from zero and the chroma samples of the \nscene may gradually diverge from 128. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 When two pictures are labelled to belong to the same scene transition and their scene_transition_type is \"Fade from \nblack\", the later one in output order is lighter than the previous one. \n\"Dissolve\" indicates that the sample values of each target picture (before encoding) were generated by calculating a sum \nof co-located weighted sample values of a picture from the current scene and a picture from the next scene. The weight of \nthe current scene gradually decreases from full level to zero level, whereas the weight of the next scene gradually increases \nfrom  zero  level  to  full  level.  When  two  pictures  are  labelled  to belong  to  the  same  scene  transition  and  their \nscene_transition_type is \"Dissolve\", the weight of the current scene for the later one, in output order, is less than the weight \nof the current scene for the previous one, and the weight of the next scene for the later one, in output order, is greater than \nthe weight of the next scene for the previous one. \n\"Wipe\" indicates that some of the sample values of each target picture (before encoding) were generated by copying \nco-located sample values of a picture in the current scene and the remaining sample values of each target picture (before \nencoding) were generated by copying co-located sample values of a picture in the next scene. When two pictures are \nlabelled to belong to the same scene transition and their scene_transition_type is \"Wipe\", the number of samples copied \nfrom the next scene to the later picture in output order is greater than the number of samples copied from the next scene to \nthe previous picture. \nsecond_scene_id identifies the next scene in the gradual scene transition in which the target pictures are involved. The \nvalue of second_scene_id shall not be equal to the value of scene_id. The value of second_scene_id shall not be equal to \nthe value of scene_id in the previous picture in output order. When the next picture in output order is marked with a value \nof scene_transition_type less than 4, and the value of second_scene_id is the same as the value of scene_id of the next \npicture in output order, this indicates that the encoder considers one of the source scenes for the target pictures and the \nsource scene for the next picture (in output order) to have been the same scene. When the value of second_scene_id is not \nequal to the value of scene_id or second_scene_id (if present) of the next picture in output order, this indicates that the \nencoder considers the target pictures and the next picture (in output order) to have been from different source scenes. \nWhen the value of scene_id of a picture is equal to the value of scene_id of the following picture in output order and the \nvalue of scene_transition_type in both of these pictures is less than 4, this indicates that the encoder considers the two \npictures  to  have  been  from  the  same  source  scene.  When  the  values  of  scene_id,  scene_transition_type  and \nsecond_scene_id (if present) of a picture are equal to the values of scene_id, scene_transition_type and second_scene_id \n \n\n(respectively) of the following picture in output order and the value of scene_transition_type is greater than 0, this indicates \nthat the encoder considers the two pictures to have been from the same source gradual scene transition. \nThe value of second_scene_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of second_scene_id in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive, and in the range of 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as \ndetermined by the application. Values of second_scene_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, and in the range of 231 \nto 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of second_scene_id \nin the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, or in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore (remove from the bitstream \nand discard) it. \nD.2.12  Sub-sequence information SEI message semantics \nThe sub-sequence information SEI message is used to indicate the position of a picture in data dependency hierarchy that \nconsists of sub-sequence layers and sub-sequences. \nA sub-sequence layer contains a subset of the coded pictures in a sequence. Sub-sequence layers are numbered with \nnon-negative integers. A layer having a larger layer number is a higher layer than a layer having a smaller layer number. \nThe layers are ordered hierarchically based on their dependency on each other so that any picture in a layer shall not be \npredicted from any picture on any higher layer. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 In other words, any picture in layer 0 must not be predicted from any picture in layer 1 or above, pictures in layer 1 may \nbe predicted from layer 0, pictures in layer 2 may be predicted from layers 0 and 1, etc. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The subjective quality is expected to increase along with the number of decoded layers. \nA sub-sequence is a set of coded pictures within a sub-sequence layer. A picture shall reside in one sub-sequence layer and \nin one sub-sequence only. Any picture in a sub-sequence shall not be predicted from any picture in another sub-sequence \nin the same or in a higher sub-sequence layer. A sub-sequence in layer 0 can be decoded independently of any picture that \ndoes not belong to the sub-sequence. \nThe sub-sequence information SEI message concerns the current access unit. The primary coded picture in the access unit \nis herein referred to as the current picture. \nThe sub-sequence information SEI message shall not be present unless gaps_in_frame_num_value_allowed_flag in the \nsequence parameter set referenced by the picture associated with the sub-sequence SEI message is equal to 1. \nsub_seq_layer_num specifies the sub-sequence layer number of the current picture. When sub_seq_layer_num is greater \nthan 0, memory management control operations shall not be used in any slice header of the current picture. When the \ncurrent picture resides in a sub-sequence for which the first picture in decoding order is an IDR picture, the value of \nsub_seq_layer_num shall be equal to 0. For a non-paired reference field, the value of sub_seq_layer_num shall be equal \nto 0. sub_seq_layer_num shall be in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive. \nsub_seq_id identifies the sub-sequence within a layer. When the current picture resides in a sub-sequence for which the \nfirst picture in decoding order is an IDR picture, the value of sub_seq_id shall be the same as the value of idr_pic_id of the \nIDR picture. sub_seq_id shall be in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. \nfirst_ref_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current picture is the first reference picture of the sub-sequence in decoding \norder. When the current picture is not the first picture of the sub-sequence in decoding order, the first_ref_pic_flag shall \nbe equal to 0. \nleading_non_ref_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current picture is a non-reference picture preceding any reference \npicture in decoding order within the sub-sequence or that the sub-sequence contains no reference pictures. When the current \npicture is a reference picture or the current picture is a non-reference picture succeeding at least one reference picture in \ndecoding order within the sub-sequence, the leading_non_ref_pic_flag shall be equal to 0. \nlast_pic_flag equal to 1 indicates that the current picture is the last picture of the sub-sequence (in decoding order), \nincluding all reference and non-reference pictures of the sub-sequence. When the current picture is not the last picture of \nthe sub-sequence (in decoding order), last_pic_flag shall be equal to 0. \nThe current picture is assigned to a sub-sequence as follows: \n\u2013  If one or more of the following conditions are true, the current picture is the first picture of a sub-sequence in decoding \norder: \n\u2013  no earlier picture in decoding order is labelled with the same values of sub_seq_id and sub_seq_layer_num as \nthe current picture, \n\u2013  the value of leading_non_ref_pic_flag is equal to 1 and the value of leading_non_ref_pic_flag is equal to 0 in \nthe previous picture in decoding order having the same values of sub_seq_id and sub_seq_layer_num as the \ncurrent picture, \n \n\n\u2013  the value of first_ref_pic_flag is equal to 1 and the value of leading_non_ref_pic_flag is equal to 0 in the previous \npicture in decoding order having the same values of sub_seq_id and sub_seq_layer_num as the current picture, \n\u2013  the value of last_pic_flag is equal to 1 in the previous picture in decoding order having the same values of \nsub_seq_id and sub_seq_layer_num as the current picture. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the current picture belongs to the same sub-sequence as the previous picture in decoding order having the \nsame values of sub_seq_id and sub_seq_layer_num as the current picture. \nsub_seq_frame_num_flag equal to 0 specifies that sub_seq_frame_num is not present. sub_seq_frame_num_flag equal \nto 1 specifies that sub_seq_frame_num is present. \nsub_seq_frame_num shall be equal to 0 for the first reference picture of the sub-sequence and for any non-reference \npicture preceding the first reference picture of the sub-sequence in decoding order. sub_seq_frame_num is further \nconstrained as follows: \n\u2013  If the current picture is not the second field of a complementary field pair, sub_seq_frame_num shall be incremented \nby 1, in modulo MaxFrameNum operation, relative to the previous reference picture, in decoding order, that belongs \nto the sub-sequence. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture is the second field of a complementary field pair), the value of sub_seq_frame_num \nshall be the same as the value of sub_seq_frame_num for the first field of the complementary field pair. \nsub_seq_frame_num shall be in the range of 0 to MaxFrameNum \u2212 1, inclusive. \nWhen the current picture is an IDR picture, it shall start a new sub-sequence in sub-sequence layer 0. Thus, the \nsub_seq_layer_num shall be 0, the sub_seq_id shall be different from the previous sub-sequence in sub-sequence layer 0, \nfirst_ref_pic_flag shall be 1, and leading_non_ref_pic_flag shall be equal to 0. \nWhen the sub-sequence information SEI message is present for both coded fields of a complementary field pair, the values \nof sub_seq_layer_num, sub_seq_id, leading_non_ref_pic_flag and sub_seq_frame_num, when present, shall be the same \nfor both of these pictures. \nWhen the sub-sequence information SEI message is present only for one coded field of a complementary field pair, the \nvalues of sub_seq_layer_num, sub_seq_id, leading_non_ref_pic_flag and sub_seq_frame_num, when present, are also \napplicable to the other coded field of the complementary field pair. \nD.2.13  Sub-sequence layer characteristics SEI message semantics \nThe sub-sequence layer characteristics SEI message specifies the characteristics of sub-sequence layers. \nnum_sub_seq_layers_minus1  plus  1  specifies  the  number  of  sub-sequence  layers  in  the  sequence. \nnum_sub_seq_layers_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive. \nA  pair  of  average_bit_rate  and  average_frame_rate  characterizes  each  sub-sequence  layer.  The  first  pair  of \naverage_bit_rate and average_frame_rate specifies the characteristics of sub-sequence layer 0. When present, the second \npair specifies the characteristics of sub-sequence layers 0 and 1 jointly. Each pair in decoding order specifies the \ncharacteristics for a range of sub-sequence layers from layer number 0 to the layer number specified by the layer loop \ncounter. The values are in effect from the point they are decoded until an update of the values is decoded. \naccurate_statistics_flag equal to 1 indicates that the values of average_bit_rate and average_frame_rate are rounded from \nstatistically  correct  values.  accurate_statistics_flag  equal  to 0  indicates  that  the  average_bit_rate  and  the \naverage_frame_rate are estimates and may deviate somewhat from the correct values. \nWhen accurate_statistics_flag is equal to 0, the quality of the approximation used in the computation of the values of \naverage_bit_rate  and  the  average_frame_rate  is  chosen  by  the  encoding  process  and  is  not  specified  by  this \nRecommendation | International Standard. \naverage_bit_rate indicates the average bit rate in units of 1000 bits per second. All NAL units in the range of sub-sequence \nlayers specified above are taken into account in the calculation. The average bit rate is derived according to the access unit \nremoval time specified in Annex C of the Recommendation | International Standard. In the following, bTotal is the number \nof bits in all NAL units succeeding a sub-sequence layer characteristics SEI message (including the bits of the NAL units \nof the current access unit) and preceding the next access unit (in decoding order) including a sub-sequence layer \ncharacteristics SEI message (if present) or the end of the stream (otherwise). t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the \n1\ncurrent access unit, and t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the latest access unit (in decoding order) before the next sub-\n2\nsequence layer characteristics SEI message (if present) or the end of the stream (otherwise). \nWhen accurate_statistics_flag is equal to 1, the following conditions shall be fulfilled as follows: \n\u2013  If t  is not equal to t , the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_bit_rate  = =  Round( bTotal \u00f7 ( ( t  \u2212 t  ) * 1000 ) ) )  (D-6) \n2 1\n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise (t  is equal to t ), the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_bit_rate  = =  0    (D-7) \naverage_frame_rate indicates the average frame rate in units of frames/(256 seconds). All NAL units in the range of sub-\nsequence layers specified above are taken into account in the calculation. In the following, fTotal is the number of frames, \ncomplementary field pairs and non-paired fields between the current picture (inclusive) and the next sub-sequence layer \ncharacteristics SEI message (if present) or the end of the stream (otherwise). t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the \n1\ncurrent access unit, and t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the latest access unit (in decoding order) before the next sub-\n2\nsequence layer characteristics SEI message (if present) or the end of the stream (otherwise). \nWhen accurate_statistics_flag is equal to 1, the following conditions shall be fulfilled as follows: \n\u2013  If t  is not equal to t , the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_frame_rate  = =  Round( fTotal * 256 \u00f7 ( t  \u2212 t  ) )  (D-8) \n2 1\n\u2013  Otherwise (t  is equal to t ), the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_frame_rate  = =  0    (D-9) \nD.2.14  Sub-sequence characteristics SEI message semantics \nThe sub-sequence characteristics SEI message indicates the characteristics of a sub-sequence. It also indicates inter \nprediction dependencies between sub-sequences. This message shall be contained in the first access unit in decoding order \nof the sub-sequence to which the sub-sequence characteristics SEI message applies. This sub-sequence is herein called the \ntarget sub-sequence. \nsub_seq_layer_num identifies the sub-sequence layer number of the target sub-sequence. sub_seq_layer_num shall be in \nthe range of 0 to 255, inclusive. \nsub_seq_id identifies the target sub-sequence. sub_seq_id shall be in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. \nduration_flag equal to 0 indicates that the duration of the target sub-sequence is not specified. \nsub_seq_duration specifies the duration of the target sub-sequence in clock ticks of a 90-kHz clock. \naverage_rate_flag equal to 0 indicates that the average bit rate and the average frame rate of the target sub-sequence are \nunspecified. \naccurate_statistics_flag  indicates  how  reliable  the  values  of  average_bit_rate  and  average_frame_rate  are. \naccurate_statistics_flag equal to 1, indicates that the average_bit_rate and the average_frame_rate are rounded from \nstatistically  correct  values.  accurate_statistics_flag  equal  to 0  indicates  that  the  average_bit_rate  and  the \naverage_frame_rate are estimates and may deviate from the statistically correct values. \naverage_bit_rate indicates the average bit rate in (1000 bits)/second of the target sub-sequence. All NAL units of the \ntarget sub-sequence are taken into account in the calculation. The average bit rate is derived according to the access unit \nremoval time specified in clause C.1.2. In the following, nB is the number of bits in all NAL units in the sub-sequence. t  \n1\nis the removal time (in seconds) of the first access unit of the sub-sequence (in decoding order), and t  is the removal time \n2\n(in seconds) of the last access unit of the sub-sequence (in decoding order). \nWhen accurate_statistics_flag is equal to 1, the following conditions shall be fulfilled as follows: \n\u2013  If t  is not equal to t , the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_bit_rate  = =  Round( nB \u00f7 ( ( t  \u2212 t  ) * 1000 ) )  (D-10) \n2 1\n\u2013  Otherwise (t  is equal to t ), the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_bit_rate  = =  0    (D-11) \naverage_frame_rate indicates the average frame rate in units of frames/(256 seconds) of the target sub-sequence. All \nNAL units of the target sub-sequence are taken into account in the calculation. The average frame rate is derived according \nto the access unit removal time specified in clause C.1.2. In the following, fC is the number of frames, complementary \nfield pairs and non-paired fields in the sub-sequence. t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the first access unit of the sub-\n1\nsequence (in decoding order), and t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the last access unit of the sub-sequence (in decoding \n2\norder). \nWhen accurate_statistics_flag is equal to 1, the following conditions shall be fulfilled as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  If t  is not equal to t , the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_frame_rate  = =  Round( fC * 256 \u00f7 ( t  \u2212 t  ) )  (D-12) \n2 1\n\u2013  Otherwise (t  is equal to t ), the following condition shall be true: \n1 2\naverage_frame_rate  = =  0    (D-13) \nnum_referenced_subseqs specifies the number of sub-sequences that contain pictures that are used as reference pictures \nfor inter prediction in the pictures of the target sub-sequence. num_referenced_subseqs shall be in the range of 0 to 255, \ninclusive. \nref_sub_seq_layer_num, ref_sub_seq_id, and ref_sub_seq_direction identify the sub-sequence that contains pictures \nthat are used as reference pictures for inter prediction in the pictures of the target sub-sequence. Depending on \nref_sub_seq_direction, the following applies: \n\u2013  If ref_sub_seq_direction is equal to 0, a set of candidate sub-sequences consists of the sub-sequences which have a \nvalue of sub_seq_id equal to ref_sub_seq_id, which reside in the sub-sequence layer having sub_seq_layer_num equal \nto ref_sub_seq_layer_num, and for which the first picture in decoding order precedes the first picture of the target \nsub-sequence in decoding order. \n\u2013  Otherwise (ref_sub_seq_direction is equal to 1), a set of candidate sub-sequences consists of the sub-sequences which \nhave  a  value  of  sub_seq_id  equal  to  ref_sub_seq_id,  which  reside  in  the  sub-sequence  layer  having \nsub_seq_layer_num equal to ref_sub_seq_layer_num, and for which the first picture in decoding order succeeds the \nfirst picture of the target sub-sequence in decoding order. \nThe sub-sequence used as a reference for the target sub-sequence is the sub-sequence among the set of candidate \nsub-sequences for which the first picture is the closest to the first picture of the target sub-sequence in decoding order. \nD.2.15  Full-frame freeze SEI message semantics \nThe full-frame freeze SEI message indicates that the current picture and any subsequent pictures in output order that meet \nspecified conditions should not affect the content of the display. No more than one full-frame freeze SEI message shall be \npresent in any access unit. \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period specifies the persistence of the full-frame freeze SEI message and may specify a \npicture order count interval within which another full-frame freeze SEI message or a full-frame freeze release SEI message \nor the end of the coded video sequence shall be present in the bitstream. The value of full_frame_freeze_repetition_period \nshall be in the range of 0 to 16 384, inclusive. \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period equal to 0 specifies that the full-frame freeze SEI message applies to the current \ndecoded picture only. \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period equal to 1 specifies that the full-frame freeze SEI message persists in output order \nuntil any of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a full-frame freeze SEI message or a full-frame freeze release SEI message is \noutput having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ). \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period greater than 1 specifies that the full-frame freeze SEI message persists until any of \nthe following conditions are true:. \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a full-frame freeze SEI message or a full-frame freeze release SEI message is \noutput having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period. \nfull_frame_freeze_repetition_period greater than 1 indicates that another full-frame freeze SEI message or a full-frame \nfreeze release SEI message shall be present for a picture in an access unit that is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + full_frame_freeze_repetition_period; unless the \nbitstream ends or a new coded video sequence begins without output of such a picture. \nD.2.16  Full-frame freeze release SEI message semantics \nThe full-frame freeze release SEI message cancels the effect of any full-frame freeze SEI message sent with pictures that \nprecede the current picture in output order. The full-frame freeze release SEI message indicates that the current picture and \nsubsequent pictures in output order should affect the contents of the display. \n \n\nNo more than one full-frame freeze release SEI message shall be present in any access unit. A full-frame freeze release \nSEI message shall not be present in an access unit containing a full-frame freeze SEI message. When a full-frame freeze \nSEI message is present in an access unit containing a field of a complementary field pair in which the values of \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) for the two fields of the complementary field pair are equal to each other, a full-frame freeze release \nSEI message shall not be present in either of the two access units. \nD.2.17  Full-frame snapshot SEI message semantics \nThe full-frame snapshot SEI message indicates that the current frame is labelled for use as determined by the application \nas a still-image snapshot of the video content. \nsnapshot_id specifies a snapshot identification number. snapshot_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of snapshot_id in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive, and in the range of 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as \ndetermined by the application.

When a condition \nbelow becomes true, the next slice to be decoded does not belong to the tagged set of consecutive coded pictures: \n\u2013  The next slice to be decoded belongs to an IDR picture. \n\u2013  num_refinement_steps_minus1 is greater than 0 and the frame_num of the next slice to be decoded is (currFrameNum \n+ num_refinement_steps_minus1 + 1) % MaxFrameNum, where currFrameNum is the value of frame_num of the \npicture in the access unit containing the SEI message. \n\u2013  num_refinement_steps_minus1  is  0  and  a  progressive  refinement  segment  end  SEI  message  with  the  same \nprogressive_refinement_id as the one in this SEI message is decoded. \nThe decoding order of pictures within the tagged set of consecutive pictures should be the same as their output order. \nprogressive_refinement_id  specifies  an  identification  number  for  the  progressive  refinement  operation. \nprogressive_refinement_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of progressive_refinement_id in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive, and in the range of 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may \nbe used as determined by the application.

Values of progressive_refinement_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, and \nin the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of \n \n\nprogressive_refinement_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, or in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore \n(remove from the bitstream and discard) it. \nD.2.20  Motion-constrained slice group set SEI message semantics \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The syntax of the motion-constrained slice group set SEI message is dependent on the content of the picture parameter \nset that is active for the primary coded picture associated with the motion-constrained slice group set SEI message. However, the \nactivation of the associated picture parameter set does not occur until the decoding of the first coded slice NAL unit of the primary \ncoded picture. Since the coded slice NAL units of the primary coded picture follow the motion-constrained slice group set SEI \nmessage in NAL unit order, it may be necessary for a decoder to store the RBSP containing the motion-constrained slice group set \nSEI message until determining the parameters of the picture parameter set that will be active for the primary coded picture, and then \nperform the parsing of the motion-constrained slice group set SEI message. \nThis SEI message indicates that inter prediction over slice group boundaries is constrained as specified below. When \npresent, the message shall only appear where it is associated, as specified in clause 7.4.1.2.3, with an IDR access unit. \nThe target picture set for this SEI message contains all consecutive primary coded pictures in decoding order starting with \nthe associated primary coded IDR picture (inclusive) and ending with the following primary coded IDR picture (exclusive) \nor with the very last primary coded picture in the bitstream (inclusive) in decoding order when there is no following primary \ncoded IDR picture. The slice group set is a collection of one or more slice groups, identified by the slice_group_id[ i ] \nsyntax element. When separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 1, the term \"primary coded pictures\" represents the parts of \nthe corresponding primary coded pictures that correspond to the NAL units having the same colour_plane_id. \nThis SEI message indicates that, for each picture in the target picture set, the inter prediction process is constrained as \nfollows: No sample value outside the slice group set, and no sample value at a fractional sample position that is derived \nusing one or more sample values outside the slice group set is used for inter prediction of any sample within the slice group \nset. \nnum_slice_groups_in_set_minus1 + 1 specifies the number of slice groups in the slice group set. The allowed range of \nnum_slice_groups_in_set_minus1  is  0  to  num_slice_groups_minus1,  inclusive.  The  allowed  range  of \nnum_slice_groups_minus1 is specified in Annex A and clauses G.10 and H.10. \nslice_group_id[ i ] with i = 0.. num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1 identifies the slice group(s) contained within the slice \ngroup set. The allowed range for slice_group_id[ i ] is from 0 to num_slice_groups_minus1, inclusive. The length of the \nslice_group_id[ i ] syntax element is Ceil( Log2( num_slice_groups_minus1 + 1 ) ) bits. \nWhen num_slice_groups_minus1 is equal to 0 (i.e., num_slice_groups_in_set_minus1 is equal to 0 and slice_group_id[ 0 ] \nis not present), the value of slice_group_id[ 0 ] shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nexact_sample_value_match_flag equal to 0 indicates that, within the target picture set, when the macroblocks that do not \nbelong to the slice group set are not decoded, the value of each sample in the slice group set need not be exactly the same \nas the value of the same sample when all the macroblocks are decoded. exact_sample_value_match_flag equal to 1 \nindicates that, within the target picture set, when the macroblocks that do not belong to the slice group set are not decoded, \nthe value of each sample in the slice group set shall be exactly the same as the value of the same sample when all the \nmacroblocks in the target picture set are decoded. \nNOTE 2  \u2013  When  disable_deblocking_filter_idc  is  equal  to  1  or  2  in  all  slices  in  the  target  picture  set, \nexact_sample_value_match_flag should be 1. \npan_scan_rect_flag equal to 0 specifies that pan_scan_rect_id is not present. pan_scan_rect_flag equal to 1 specifies that \npan_scan_rect_id is present. \npan_scan_rect_id indicates that the specified slice group set covers at least the pan-scan rectangle identified by \npan_scan_rect_id within the target picture set. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 Multiple motion_constrained_slice_group_set SEI messages may be associated with the same IDR picture. Consequently, \nmore than one slice group set may be active within a target picture set. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 The size, shape, and location of the slice groups in the slice group set may change within the target picture set. \nD.2.21  Film grain characteristics SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message provides the decoder with a parameterised model for film grain synthesis. For example, an encoder may \nuse the film grain characteristics SEI message to characterize film grain that was present in the original source video \nmaterial and was removed by pre-processing filtering techniques. Synthesis of simulated film grain on the decoded images \nfor the display process is optional and does not affect the decoding process specified in this Recommendation | International \nStandard. If synthesis of simulated film grain on the decoded images for the display process is performed, there is no \nrequirement that the method by which the synthesis is performed be the same as the parameterised model for the film grain \nas provided in the film grain characteristics SEI message. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The display process is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \n \n\nNOTE 2 \u2013 The Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers document RDD 5-2006 \"Film Grain Technology \u2013 Specifications \nfor H.264/MPEG-4 AVC Bitstreams\" specifies a film grain simulator based on the information provided in the film grain \ncharacteristics SEI message. \nfilm_grain_characteristics_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the SEI message cancels the persistence of any previous \nfilm grain characteristics SEI message in output order. film_grain_characteristics_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that film \ngrain modelling information follows. \nfilm_grain_model_id  identifies  the  film  grain  simulation  model  as  specified  in  Table D-5.  The  value  of \nfilm_grain_model_id shall be in the range of 0 to 1, inclusive. The values of 2 and 3 for film_grain_model_id are reserved \nfor future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore film grain characteristic SEI messages with film_grain_model_id \nequal to 2 or 3. \nTable D-5 \u2013 film_grain_model_id values \n \nValue  Description \n0  frequency filtering  \n1  auto-regression \n2  reserved \n3  reserved \n \nseparate_colour_description_present_flag equal to 1 indicates that a distinct colour space description for the film grain \ncharacteristics  specified  in  the  SEI  message  is  present  in  the  film  grain  characteristics  SEI  message  syntax. \nseparate_colour_description_present_flag equal to 0 indicates that the colour description for the film grain characteristics \nspecified in the SEI message is the same as for the coded video sequence as specified in clause E.2.1. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When separate_colour_description_present_flag is equal to 1, the colour space specified for the film grain characteristics \nspecified in the SEI message may differ from the colour space specified for the coded video as specified in clause E.2.1. \nfilm_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8 plus 8 specifies the bit depth used for the luma component of the film grain \ncharacteristics specified in the SEI message. When film_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8 is not present in the film grain \ncharacteristics  SEI  message,  the  value  of  film_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8  shall  be  inferred  to  be  equal \nto bit_depth_luma_minus8. \nThe value of filmGrainBitDepth[ 0 ] is derived as \nfilmGrainBitDepth[ 0 ] = film_grain_bit_depth_luma_minus8 + 8  (D-14) \nfilm_grain_bit_depth_chroma_minus8 plus 8 specifies the bit depth used for the Cb and Cr components of the film grain \ncharacteristics specified in the SEI message. When film_grain_bit_depth_chroma_minus8 is not present in the film grain \ncharacteristics  SEI  message,  the  value  of  film_grain_bit_depth_chroma_minus8  shall  be  inferred  to  be  equal \nto bit_depth_chroma_minus8. \nThe value of filmGrainBitDepth[ c ] for c = 1 and 2 is derived as \nfilmGrainBitDepth[ c ] = film_grain_bit_depth_chroma_minus8 + 8    with c = 1, 2  (D-15) \nfilm_grain_full_range_flag has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the video_full_range_flag syntax \nelement, except as follows: \n\u2013  film_grain_full_range_flag specifies the colour space of the film grain characteristics specified in the SEI message, \nrather than the colour space used for the coded video sequence. \n\u2013  When  film_grain_full_range_flag  is  not  present  in  the  film  grain  characteristics  SEI  message,  the  value  of \nfilm_grain_full_range_flag shall be inferred to be equal to video_full_range_flag. \nfilm_grain_colour_primaries has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the colour_primaries syntax \nelement, except as follows: \n\u2013  film_grain_colour_primaries specifies the colour space of the film grain characteristics specified in the SEI message, \nrather than the colour space used for the coded video sequence. \n\u2013  When film_grain_colour_primaries is not present in the film grain characteristics SEI message, the value of \nfilm_grain_colour_primaries shall be inferred to be equal to colour_primaries. \nfilm_grain_transfer_characteristics has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the transfer_characteristics \nsyntax element, except as follows: \n \n\n\u2013  film_grain_transfer_characteristics specifies the colour space of the film grain characteristics specified in the SEI \nmessage, rather than the colour space used for the coded video sequence. \n\u2013  When film_grain_transfer_characteristics is not present in the film grain characteristics SEI message, the value of \nfilm_grain_transfer_characteristics shall be inferred to be equal to transfer_characteristics. \nfilm_grain_matrix_coefficients has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the matrix_coefficients syntax \nelement, except as follows: \n\u2013  film_grain_matrix_coefficients specifies the colour space of the film grain characteristics specified in the SEI \nmessage, rather than the colour space used for the coded video sequence. \n\u2013  When film_grain_matrix_coefficients is not present in the film grain characteristics SEI message, the value of \nfilm_grain_matrix_coefficients shall be inferred to be equal to matrix_coefficients. \n\u2013  The values allowed for film_grain_matrix_coefficients are not constrained by the value of chroma_format_idc. \nThe chroma_format_idc of the film grain characteristics specified in the film grain characteristics SEI message shall be \ninferred to be equal to 3 (4:4:4). \nNOTE 4 \u2013 Because the use of a specific method is not required for performing film grain generation function used by the display \nprocess, a decoder may, if desired, down-convert the model information for chroma in order to simulate film grain for other chroma \nformats (4:2:0 or 4:2:2) rather than up-converting the decoded video (using a method not specified by this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard) before performing film grain generation. \nblending_mode_id identifies the blending mode used to blend the simulated film grain with the decoded images as \nspecified in Table D-6. blending_mode_id shall be in the range of 0 to 1, inclusive. \nTable D-6 \u2013 blending_mode_id values \n \nValue  Description \n0  additive  \n1  multiplicative \n2  reserved \n3  reserved \n \nDepending on blending_mode_id, the blending mode is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If blending_mode_id is equal to 0 the blending mode is additive as specified by \nI [ x, y, c ] = Clip3( 0, ( 1 << filmGrainBitDepth[ c ] ) \u2212 1, I [ x, y, c ] + G[ x, y, c ] )  (D-16) \ngrain decoded\n\u2013  Otherwise (blending_mode_id is equal to 1), the blending mode is multiplicative as specified by \nI [ x, y, c ] = Clip3( 0, ( 1 << filmGrainBitDepth[ c ] ) \u2212 1, I [ x, y, c ]  (D-17) \ngrain decoded\n                                         + Round( ( I [ x, y, c ] * G[ x, y, c ] ) \u00f7 ( ( 1 << bitDepth[ c ] ) \u2212 1 ) ) ) \ndecoded\nwhere I [ x, y, c ] represents the sample value at coordinates x, y of the colour component c of the decoded image \ndecoded\nI , G[ x, y, c ] is the simulated film grain value at the same position and colour component, filmGrainBitDepth[ c ] is \ndecoded\nthe number of bits used for each sample in a fixed-length unsigned binary representation of the array I [ x, y, c ], and \ngrain\nbitDepth[ c ] is specified by \nbitDepth[ c ] = \uf0ecBitDepthY ;

The means by which an encoder \ndetermines what to indicate as its preference expressed in a deblocking filter display preference SEI message is also not specified in \nthis Recommendation | International Standard, and the expression of an expressed preference in a deblocking filter display preference \nSEI message does not impose any requirement on the display process. \ndeblocking_display_preference_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the SEI message cancels the persistence of any \nprevious deblocking filter display preference SEI message in output order. deblocking_display_preference_cancel_flag \nequal  to  0  indicates  that  a  display_prior_to_deblocking_preferred_flag  and \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period follow. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 In the absence of the deblocking filter display preference SEI message, or after the receipt of a deblocking filter display \npreference SEI message in which deblocking_display_preference_cancel_flag is equal to 1, the decoder should infer that the display \nof the cropped result of the deblocking filter process specified in clause 8.7 is preferred over the display of the cropped result of the \npicture construction process prior to the deblocking filter process specified in clause 8.5.14 for the display of each decoded picture \nthat is output. \ndisplay_prior_to_deblocking_preferred_flag equal to 1 indicates that the encoder preference is for the display process \n(which is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard) to display the cropped result of the picture \nconstruction process prior to the deblocking filter process specified in clause 8.5.14 rather than the cropped result of the \ndeblocking filter process specified in clause 8.7 for each picture that is cropped and output as specified in Annex C. \ndisplay_prior_to_deblocking_preferred_flag equal to 0 indicates that the encoder preference is for the display process \n(which is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard) to display the cropped result of the deblocking \nfilter process specified in clause 8.7 rather than the cropped result of the picture construction process prior to the \ndeblocking filter process specified in clause 8.5.14 for each picture that is cropped and output as specified in Annex C. \nNOTE  3  \u2013  The  presence  or  absence  of  the  deblocking  filter  display  preference  SEI  message  and  the  value  of \ndisplay_prior_to_deblocking_preferred_flag  does  not  affect  the  requirements  of  the  decoding  process  specified  in  this \nRecommendation | International Standard. Rather, it only provides an indication of when, in addition to fulfilling the requirements \nof this Recommendation | International Standard for the decoding process, enhanced visual quality might be obtained by performing \nthe display process (which is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard) in an alternative fashion. Encoders that \nuse the deblocking filter display preference SEI message should be designed with an awareness that unless the encoder restricts its \nuse of the DPB capacity specified in Annex A and clauses G.10 and H.10 for the profile and level in use, some decoders may not \nhave sufficient memory capacity for the storage of the result of the picture construction process prior to the deblocking filter process \nspecified in clause 8.5.14 in addition to the storage of the result of the deblocking filter process specified in clause 8.7 when \nreordering and delaying pictures for display, and such decoders would therefore not be able to benefit from the preference indication. \nBy restricting its use of the DPB capacity, an encoder can be able to use at least half of the DPB capacity specified in Annex A and \nclauses G.10 and H.10 while allowing the decoder to use the remaining capacity for storage of unfiltered pictures that have been \nindicated as preferable for display until the output time arrives for those pictures. \n \n\ndec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag equal to 1 indicates that the use of the frame buffering capacity of the HRD \ndecoded picture buffer (DPB) as specified by max_dec_frame_buffering has been constrained such that the coded video \nsequence will not require a decoded picture buffer with more than Max( 1, max_dec_frame_buffering ) frame buffers to \nenable the output of the decoded filtered or unfiltered pictures, as indicated by the deblocking filter display preference SEI \nmessages,  at  the  output  times  specified  by  the  dpb_output_delay  of  the  picture  timing  SEI  messages. \ndec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag equal to 0 indicates that the use of the frame buffering capacity in the HRD may or \nmay not be constrained in the manner that would be indicated by dec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag equal to 1. \nFor purposes of determining the constraint imposed when dec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag is equal to 1, the quantity \nof frame buffering capacity used at any given point in time by each frame buffer of the DPB that contains a picture shall \nbe derived as follows: \n\u2013  If both of the following criteria are satisfied for the frame buffer, the frame buffer is considered to use two frame \nbuffers of capacity for its storage. \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a frame or one or more fields that is marked as \"used for reference\", and \n\u2013  The frame buffer contains a picture for which both of the following criteria are fulfilled: \n\u2013  The HRD output time of the picture is greater than the given point in time. \n\u2013  It has been indicated in a deblocking filter display preference SEI message that the encoder preference for \nthe picture is for the display process to display the cropped result of the picture construction process prior \nto the deblocking filter process specified in clause 8.5.14 rather than the cropped result of the deblocking \nfilter process specified in clause 8.7. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the frame buffer is considered to use one frame buffer of DPB capacity for its storage. \nWhen dec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag is equal to 1, the frame buffering capacity used by all of the frame buffers in \nthe DPB that contain pictures, as derived in this manner, shall not be greater than Max( 1, max_dec_frame_buffering ) \nduring the operation of the HRD for the coded video sequence. \nThe value of dec_frame_buffering_constraint_flag shall be the same in all deblocking filter display preference SEI \nmessages of the coded video sequence. \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period specifies the persistence of the deblocking filter display preference \nSEI message and may specify a picture order count interval within which another deblocking filter display preference \nmessage  or  the  end  of  the  coded  video  sequence  shall  be  present  in  the  bitstream.  The  value  of \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period shall be in the range 0 to 16 384, inclusive. \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period equal to 0 specifies that the deblocking filter display preference SEI \nmessage applies to the current decoded picture only. \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period equal to 1 specifies that the deblocking filter display preference SEI \nmessage persists in output order until any of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a deblocking filter display preference SEI message is output having \nPicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ). \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period greater than 1 specifies that the deblocking filter display preference SEI \nmessage persists until any of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a deblocking filter display preference SEI message is output having \nPicOrderCnt( )  greater  than  PicOrderCnt( CurrPic )  and  less  than  or  equal  to  PicOrderCnt( CurrPic )  + \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period. \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period  greater  than  1  indicates  that  another deblocking  filter  display \npreference SEI message shall be present for a picture in an access unit that is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic )  and  less  than  or  equal  to  PicOrderCnt( CurrPic )  + \ndeblocking_display_preference_repetition_period; unless the bitstream ends or a new coded video sequence begins without \noutput of such a picture. \nD.2.23  Stereo video information SEI message semantics \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The stereo video information SEI message is included in this Specification primarily for historical reasons. It is now \nsuggested to use the frame packing arrangement SEI message rather than the stereo video information SEI message to signal stereo \nvideo information. \nThis SEI message provides the decoder with an indication that the entire coded video sequence consists of pairs of pictures \nforming stereo-view content. \n \n\nThe stereo video information SEI message shall not be present in any access unit of a coded video sequence unless a stereo \nvideo information SEI message is present in the first access unit of the coded video sequence. \nfield_views_flag equal to 1 indicates that all pictures in the current coded video sequence are fields and all fields of a \nparticular parity are considered a left view and all fields of the opposite parity are considered a right view for stereo-view \ncontent. field_views_flag equal to 0 indicates that all pictures in the current coded video sequence are frames and \nalternating frames in output order represent a view of a stereo view. The value of field_views_flag shall be the same in all \nstereo video information SEI messages within a coded video sequence. \nWhen the stereo video information SEI message is present and field_views_flag is equal to 1, the left view and right view \nof a stereo video pair shall be coded as a complementary field pair, the display time of the first field of the field pair in \noutput order should be delayed to coincide with the display time of the second field of the field pair in output order, and \nthe spatial locations of the samples in each individual field should be interpreted for display purposes as representing \ncomplete pictures as shown in Figure 6-1 rather than as spatially-distinct fields within a frame as shown in Figure 6-2. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The display process is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \ntop_field_is_left_view_flag equal to 1 indicates that the top fields in the coded video sequence represent a left view and \nthe bottom fields in the coded video sequence represent a right view. top_field_is_left_view_flag equal to 0 indicates that \nthe bottom fields in the coded video sequence represent a left view and the top fields in the coded video sequence represent \na right view. When present, the value of top_field_is_left_view_flag shall be the same in all stereo video information SEI \nmessages within a coded video sequence. \ncurrent_frame_is_left_view_flag equal to 1 indicates that the current picture is the left view of a stereo-view pair. \ncurrent_frame_is_left_view_flag equal to 0 indicates that the current picture is the right view of a stereo-view pair. \nnext_frame_is_second_view_flag equal to 1 indicates that the current picture and the next picture in output order form a \nstereo-view pair, and the display time of the current picture should be delayed to coincide with the display time of the next \npicture in output order. next_frame_is_second_view_flag equal to 0 indicates that the current picture and the previous \npicture in output order form a stereo-view pair, and the display time of the current picture should not be delayed for \npurposes of stereo-view pairing. \nleft_view_self_contained_flag equal to 1 indicates that no inter prediction operations within the decoding process for the \nleft-view  pictures  of  the  coded  video  sequence  refer  to  reference  pictures  that  are  right-view  pictures. \nleft_view_self_contained_flag equal to 0 indicates that some inter prediction operations within the decoding process for \nthe left-view pictures of the coded video sequence may or may not refer to reference pictures that are right-view pictures. \nWithin a coded video sequence, the value of left_view_self_contained_flag in all stereo video information SEI messages \nshall be the same. \nright_view_self_contained_flag equal to 1 indicates that no inter prediction operations within the decoding process for \nthe  right-view  pictures  of  the  coded  video  sequence  refer  to  reference  pictures  that  are  left-view  pictures. \nright_view_self_contained_flag equal to 0 indicates that some inter prediction operations within the decoding process for \nthe right-view pictures of the coded video sequence may or may not refer to reference pictures that are left-view pictures. \nWithin a coded video sequence, the value of right_view_self_contained_flag in all stereo video information SEI messages \nshall be the same. \nD.2.24  Post-filter hint SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message provides the coefficients of a post-filter or correlation information for the design of a post-filter for \npotential use in post-processing of the output decoded pictures to obtain improved displayed quality. \nfilter_hint_size_y specifies the vertical size of the filter coefficient or correlation array. The value of filter_hint_size_y \nshall be in the range of 1 to 15, inclusive. \nfilter_hint_size_x specifies the horizontal size of the filter coefficient or correlation array. The value of filter_hint_size_x \nshall be in the range of 1 to 15, inclusive. \nfilter_hint_type identifies the type of the transmitted filter hints as specified in Table D-7. The value of filter_hint_type \nshall be in the range of 0 to 2, inclusive. Decoders shall ignore post-filter hint SEI messages having filter_hint_type equal \nto the reserved value 3. \n \n\nTable D-7 \u2013 filter_hint_type values \n \nValue  Description \n0  coefficients of a 2D FIRfilter  \n1  coefficients of two 1D FIR filters \n2  cross-correlation matrix \n3  Reserved \n \nfilter_hint[ colour_component ][ cy ][ cx ] specifies a filter coefficient or an element of a cross-correlation matrix between \noriginal and decoded signal with 16-bit precision. The value of filter_hint[ colour_component ][ cy ][ cx ] shall be in the \nrange of \u2212231 + 1 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive. colour_component specifies the related colour component. cy represents a counter \nin vertical direction, cx represents a counter in horizontal direction. Depending on filter_hint_type, the following applies: \n\u2013  If filter_hint_type is equal to 0, the coefficients of a 2-dimensional FIR filter with the size of filter_hint_size_y * \nfilter_hint_size_x are transmitted. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if filter_hint_type is equal to 1, the filter coefficients of two 1-dimensional FIR filters are transmitted. In \nthis case, filter_hint_size_y shall be equal to 2. The index cy = 0 specifies the filter coefficients of the horizontal filter \nand cy = 1 specifies the filter coefficients of the vertical filter. In the filtering process, the horizontal filter shall be \napplied first and the result shall be filtered by the vertical filter. \n\u2013  Otherwise (filter_hint_type is equal to 2), the transmitted hints specify a cross-correlation matrix between the original \nsignal s and the decoded signal s\u2032. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The normalized cross-correlation matrix for a related colour component with the size of filter_hint_size_y * \nfilter_hint_size_x is defined as follows: \n1 h\uf02d1w\uf02d1\nfilter_hint (cy,cx)\uf03d \uf0e5 \uf0e5s(m,n)\uf0d7s\uf0a2(m\uf02bcy\uf02doffset_y,n\uf02bcx\uf02doffset_x)  (D-27) \n(28\uf02bbitDepth\uf02d1)2\uf0d7h\uf0d7wm\uf03d0n\uf03d0\nwhere s denotes the original frame, s\u2032 denotes the decoded frame, h denotes the vertical height of the related colour \ncomponent, w denotes the horizontal width of the related colour component, bitDepth denotes the bit depth of the colour \ncomponent, offset_y is equal to (filter_hint_size_y >> 1), offset_x is equal to (filter_hint_size_x >> 1), 0 <= cy < \nfilter_hint_size_y and 0 <= cx < filter_hint_size_x. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 A decoder can derive a Wiener post-filter from the cross-correlation matrix of original and decoded signal and the \nauto-correlation matrix of the decoded signal. \nadditional_extension_flag equal to 0 indicates that no additional data follows within the post-filter hint SEI message. The \nvalue of additional_extension_flag shall be equal to 0. The value of 1 for additional_extension_flag is reserved for future \nuse by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore all data that follows the value of 1 for additional_extension_flag in a post-\nfilter hint SEI message. \nD.2.25  Tone mapping information SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message provides information to enable remapping of the colour samples of the output decoded pictures for \ncustomization to particular display environments. The remapping process maps coded sample values in the RGB colour \nspace (specified in Annex E) to target sample values. The mappings are expressed in the luma or RGB colour space domain, \nand should be applied to the luma component or to each RGB component produced by colour space conversion of the \ndecoded image accordingly. \ntone_map_id contains an identifying number that may be used to identify the purpose of the tone mapping model. The \nvalue of tone_map_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of tone_map_id from 0 to 255, inclusive, and from 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as determined by the \napplication. Values of tone_map_id from 256 to 511, inclusive, and from 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, are reserved for future \nuse by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of tone_map_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, or in the \nrange of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore it. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The tone_map_id can be used to support tone mapping operations that are suitable for different display scenarios. For \nexample, different values of tone_map_id may correspond to different display bit depths. \ntone_map_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the tone mapping information SEI message cancels the persistence of any \nprevious tone mapping information SEI message in output order. tone_map_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that tone \nmapping information follows. \n \n\ntone_map_repetition_period specifies the persistence of the tone mapping information SEI message and may specify a \npicture order count interval within which another tone mapping information SEI message with the same value of \ntone_map_id  or  the  end  of  the  coded  video  sequence  shall  be  present  in  the  bitstream.  The  value  of \ntone_map_repetition_period shall be in the range of 0 to 16 384, inclusive. \ntone_map_repetition_period equal to 0 specifies that the tone map information applies to the current decoded picture only. \ntone_map_repetition_period equal to 1 specifies that the tone map information persists in output order until any of the \nfollowing conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a tone mapping information SEI message with the same value of tone_map_id \nis output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ). \ntone_map_repetition_period equal to 0 or equal to 1 indicates that another tone mapping information SEI message with \nthe same value of tone_map_id may or may not be present. \ntone_map_repetition_period greater than 1 specifies that the tone map information persists until any of the following \nconditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a tone mapping information SEI message with the same value of tone_map_id \nis output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) \n+ tone_map_repetition_period. \ntone_map_repetition_period greater than 1 indicates that another tone mapping information SEI message with the same \nvalue of tone_map_id shall be present for a picture in an access unit that is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + tone_map_repetition_period; unless the \nbitstream ends or a new coded video sequence begins without output of such a picture. \ncoded_data_bit_depth specifies the BitDepth  for interpretation of the luma component of the associated pictures for \nY\npurposes of interpretation of the tone mapping information SEI message. If tone mapping information SEI messages are \npresent that have coded_data_bit_depth that is not equal to BitDepth , these refer to the hypothetical result of a transcoding \nY\noperation performed to convert the coded video to the BitDepth  corresponding to the value of coded_data_bit_depth. \nY\nThe value of coded_data_bit_depth shall be in the range of 8 to 14, inclusive. Values of coded_data_bit_depth from 0 to 7 \nand from 15 to 255 are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and \ndiscard) all tone mapping SEI messages that contain a coded_data_bit_depth in the range of 0 to 7 or in the range of 15 to \n255, and bitstreams shall not contain such values. \ntarget_bit_depth specifies the bit depth of the output of the dynamic range mapping function (or tone mapping function) \ndescribed by the tone mapping information SEI message. The tone mapping function specified with a particular \ntarget_bit_depth is suggested to be reasonable for all display bit depths that are less than or equal to the target_bit_depth. \nThe value of target_bit_depth shall be in the range of 1 to 16, inclusive. Values of target_bit_depth equal to 0 and in the \nrange of 17 to 255 are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and \ndiscard) all tone mapping SEI messages that contain a value of target_bit_depth equal to 0 or in the range of 17 to 255, and \nbitstreams shall not contain such values. \ntone_map_model_id specifies the model utilized for mapping the coded data into the target_bit_depth range. Values \ngreater than 3 are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore (remove from the bitstream and \ndiscard) all tone mapping SEI messages that contain a value of tone_map_model_id greater than 4, and bitstreams shall \nnot contain such values. Decoders shall allow reserved values of tone_map_model_id in the range of 5 to 16 384, inclusive, \nto be present in the bitstream. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 A tone_map_model_id value of 0 corresponds to a linear mapping with clipping; a tone_map_model_id value of 1 \ncorresponds to  a  sigmoidal  mapping;  a  tone_map_model_id  value  of  2  corresponds to  a  user-defined  table  mapping,  a \ntone_map_model_id value of 3 corresponds to a piece-wise linear mapping, and a tone_map_model_id value of 4 corresponds to \nluminance dynamic range information. \nmin_value specifies the RGB sample value that maps to the minimum value in the bit depth indicated by target_bit_depth. \nIt is used in combination with the max_value parameter. All sample values of the decoded picture that are less than or \nequal to min_value after conversion to the RGB domain (when decoded in a different domain) are mapped to this minimum \nvalue in the target_bit_depth representation. \nmax_value specifies the RGB sample value that maps to the maximum value in the bit depth indicated by target_bit_depth. \nIt is used in combination with the min_value parameter. All sample values of the decoded picture that are greater than or \nequal to max_value after conversion to the RGB domain (when decoded in a different domain) are mapped to this \nmaximum value in the target_bit_depth representation. \n \n\nmax_value shall be greater than or equal to min_value. \nsigmoid_midpoint specifies the RGB sample value of the coded data that is mapped to the centre point of the \ntarget_bit_depth representation. It is used in combination with the sigmoid_width parameter. \nsigmoid_width specifies the distance between two coded data values that approximately correspond to the 5% and 95% \nvalues of the target_bit_depth representation, respectively. It is used in combination with the sigmoid_midpoint parameter \nand is interpreted according to the following function: \n\uf0e6 \uf0f6\n\uf0e7 \uf0f7\n\uf0e7 2target_bit_depth\uf02d1 \uf0f7\nf(i)\uf03dRound\uf0e7 \uf0f7 fori\uf03d0,\uf04c,(2coded_bit_depth\uf02d1)    (D-28) \n\uf0e6\uf02d6*\uf028i\uf02dsigmoid_midpoint\uf029\uf0f6\n\uf0e71\uf02bexp\uf0e7 \uf0f7\uf0f7\n\uf0e7\uf0e8 \uf0e7\uf0e8 sigmoid_width \uf0f7\uf0f8\uf0f7\uf0f8\nwhere f( i ) denotes the function that maps an RGB sample value i from the coded data to a resulting RGB sample value in \nthe target_bit_depth representation. \nstart_of_coded_interval[ i ] specifies the beginning point of an interval in the coded data such that all RGB sample values \nthat are greater than or equal to start_of_coded_interval[ i ] and less than start_of_coded_interval[ i + 1 ] are mapped to i \nin the target bit depth representation. The value of start_of_coded_interval[ 2target_bit_depth ] is equal to 2coded_bit_depth. The \nnumber of bits used for the representation of the start_of_coded_interval is ( ( coded_data_bit_depth + 7 ) >> 3 ) << 3. \nnum_pivots specifies the number of pivot points in the piece-wise linear mapping function without counting the two \ndefault end points, (0, 0) and (2coded_data_bit_depth \u2212 1, 2target_bit_depth \u2212 1) . \ncoded_pivot_value[ i ] specifies the value in the coded_data_bit_depth corresponding to the i-th pivot point. The number \nof bits used for the representation of the coded_pivot_value is ( ( coded_data_bit_depth + 7 ) >> 3 ) << 3. \ntarget_pivot_value[ i ] specifies the value in the reference target_bit_depth corresponding to the i-th pivot point. The \nnumber of bits used for the representation of the target_pivot_value is ( ( target_bit_depth + 7 ) >> 3 ) << 3. \ncamera_iso_speed_idc indicates the camera ISO speed for daylight illumination as specified by ISO 12232, interpreted \nas specified by Table D-8. When camera_iso_speed_idc indicates Extended_ISO, the ISO speed is represented by \ncamera_iso_speed_value. \ncamera_iso_speed_value indicates the camera ISO speed for daylight illumination as specified by ISO 12232 when \ncamera_iso_speed_idc is set to Extended_ISO. The value of camera_iso_speed_value shall not be equal to 0. \nexposure_index_idc indicates the exposure index setting of the camera as specified by ISO 12232, interpreted as specified \nby  Table D-8.  When  exposure_index_idc  indicates  Extended_ISO,  the  exposure  index  is  indicated  by \nexposure_index_value. \nThe values of camera_iso_speed_idc and exposure_index_idc in the range of 31 to 254, inclusive, are reserved for future \nuse by ITU-T | ISO/IEC, and shall not be present in bitstreams conforming to this version of this Specification. Decoders \nconforming to this version of this Specification shall ignore tone mapping SEI messages that contain these values. \nexposure_index_value  indicates  the  exposure  index  setting  of  the  camera  as  specified  by  ISO  12232  when \nexposure_index_idc indicates Extended_ISO. The value of exposure_index_value shall not be equal to 0. \n \n\nTable D-8 \u2013 Interpretation of camera_iso_speed_idc and exposure_index_idc \n \ncamera_iso_speed_idc or  Indicated value \nexposure_index_idc \n0  Unspecified \n1  10 \n2  12 \n3  16 \n4  20 \n5  25 \n6  32 \n7  40 \n8  50 \n9  64 \n10  80 \n11  100 \n12  125 \n13  160 \n14  200 \n15  250 \n16  320 \n17  400 \n18  500 \n19  640 \n20  800 \n21  1000 \n22  1250 \n23  1600 \n24  2000 \n25  2500 \n26  3200 \n27  4000 \n28  5000 \n29  6400 \n30  8000 \n31..254  Reserved \n255  Extended_ISO \n \n\n \nexposure_compensation_value_sign_flag,  when  applicable  as  specified  below,  specifies the  sign  of  the  variable \nExposureCompensationValue that indicates the exposure compensation value setting used for the process of image \nproduction. \nexposure_compensation_value_numerator, when applicable as specified below, specifies the numerator of the variable \nExposureCompensationValue that indicates the exposure compensation value setting used for the process of image \nproduction. \nexposure_compensation_value_denom_idc,  when  not  equal  to  0,  specifies  the  denominator  of  the  variable \nExposureCompensationValue that indicates the exposure compensation value setting used for the process of image \nproduction. \nWhen exposure_compensation_value_denom_idc is present and not equal to 0, the variable ExposureCompensationValue \nis  derived  from  exposure_compensation_value_sign_flag,  exposure_compensation_value_numerator  and \nexposure_compensation_value_denom_idc.  exposure_compensation_value_sign_flag  equal  to  0  indicates  that  the \nExposureCompensationValue  is  positive.  exposure_compensation_value_sign_flag  equal  to  1  indicates  that  the \nExposureCompensationValue is negative. When ExposureCompensationValue is positive, the image is indicated to have \nbeen further sensitized through the process of production, relative to the recommended exposure index of the camera as \nspecified by ISO 12232. When ExposureCompensationValue is negative, the image is indicated to have been further \ndesensitized through the process of production, relative to the recommended exposure index of the camera as specified by \nISO 12232. \nWhen exposure_compensation_value_denom_idc is present and not equal to 0, the variable ExposureCompensationValue \nis derived as follows: \nExposureCompensationValue = ( 1 \u2212 2 * exposure_compensation_value_sign_flag ) * \n    exposure_compensation_value_numerator \u00f7\uf020\n    exposure_compensation_value_denom_idc  (D-29) \nThe value of ExposureCompensationValue is interpreted in units of exposure steps such that an increase of 1 in \nExposureCompensationValue corresponds to a doubling of exposure in units of lux-seconds. For example, the exposure \ncompensation  value  equal  to  +1\u00f72  at  the  production  stage  may  be  indicated  by  setting \nexposure_compensation_value_sign_flag  to  0,  exposure_compensation_value_numerator  to  1,  and \nexposure_compensation_value_denom_idc to 2. \nWhen exposure_compensation_value_denom_idc is present and equal to 0, the exposure compensation value is indicated \nas unknown or unspecified. \nref_screen_luminance_white indicates the reference screen brightness setting for the extended range white level used for \nimage production process in units of candela per square metre. \nextended_range_white_level  indicates  the  luminance  dynamic  range  for  extended  dynamic-range  display  of  the \nassociated pictures, after conversion to the linear light domain for display, expressed as an integer percentage relative to \nthe nominal white level. When present, the value of extended_range_white_level should be greater than or equal to 100. \nnominal_black_level_luma_code_value specifies the luma sample value of the associated decoded pictures to which the \nnominal black level is assigned. For example, when coded_data_bit_depth is equal to 8, video_full_range_flag is equal to \n0, and matrix_coefficients is equal to 1, nominal_black_level_luma_code_value should be equal to 16. \nnominal_white_level_luma_code_value specifies the luma sample value of the associated decoded pictures to which the \nnominal white level is assigned. For example, when coded_data_bit_depth is equal to 8, video_full_range_flag is equal to \n0, and matrix_coefficients is equal to 1, nominal_white_level_luma_code_value should be equal to 235. When present, the \nvalue of nominal_white_level_luma_code_value shall be greater than nominal_black_level_luma_code_value. \nextended_white_level_luma_code_value specifies the luma sample value of the associated decoded pictures to which the \nwhite  level  associated  with  an  extended  dynamic  range  is  assigned.  When  present,  the  value  of \nextended_white_level_luma_code_value shall be greater than or equal to nominal_white_level_luma_code_value. \nD.2.26  Frame packing arrangement SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message informs the decoder that the output cropped decoded picture contains samples of multiple distinct \nspatially packed constituent frames that are packed into one frame, or that the output cropped decoded pictures in output \norder form a temporal interleaving of alternating first and second constituent frames, using an indicated frame packing \narrangement scheme. This information can be used by the decoder to appropriately rearrange and process the samples of \nthe constituent frames appropriately for display or other purposes (which are outside the scope of this Specification). \n \n\nThis SEI message may be associated with pictures that are either frames or fields. The frame packing arrangement of the \nsamples is specified in terms of the sampling structure of a frame in order to define a frame packing arrangement structure \nthat is invariant with respect to whether a picture is a single field of such a packed frame or is a complete packed frame. \nframe_packing_arrangement_id contains an identifying number that may be used to identify the usage of the frame \npacking arrangement SEI message. The value of frame_packing_arrangement_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, \ninclusive. \nValues of frame_packing_arrangement_id from 0 to 255, inclusive, and from 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as \ndetermined by the application. Values of frame_packing_arrangement_id from 256 to 511, inclusive, and from 231 to \n232 \u2212 2,  inclusive,  are  reserved  for  future  use  by  ITU-T | ISO/IEC.  Decoders  encountering  a  value  of \nframe_packing_arrangement_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, or in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore \nit. \nframe_packing_arrangement_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the frame packing arrangement SEI message cancels \nthe  persistence  of  any  previous  frame  packing  arrangement  SEI  message  in  output  order. \nframe_packing_arrangement_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that frame packing arrangement information follows. \nframe_packing_arrangement_type identifies the indicated interpretation of the sample arrays of the output cropped \ndecoded picture as specified in Table D-9. \n \nTable D-9 \u2013 Definition of frame_packing_arrangement_type \n \nValue  Interpretation \n0  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a \"checkerboard\" based interleaving of corresponding \nplanes of two constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-1. \n1  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a column based interleaving of corresponding planes of \ntwo constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-2 and Figure D-3. \n2  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a row based interleaving of corresponding planes of two \nconstituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-4 and Figure D-5. \n3  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a side-by-side packing arrangement of corresponding \nplanes of two constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-6, Figure D-7, and Figure D-10. \n4  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a top-bottom packing arrangement of corresponding \nplanes of two constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-8 and Figure D-9. \n5  The component planes of the output cropped decoded pictures in output order form a temporal interleaving \nof alternating first and second constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-11. \n6  The output cropped decoded picture constitutes a complete 2D frame (when field_pic_flag is equal to 0) or \nfield (when field_pic_flag is equal to 1) without any frame packing. \n7  The frame packing arrangement structure contains a tile format packing arrangement of corresponding \nplanes of two constituent frames as illustrated in Figure D-12. \n \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Figure D-1 to Figure D-10 provide typical examples of rearrangement and upconversion processing for various packing \narrangement schemes. Actual characteristics of the constituent frames are signalled in detail by the subsequent syntax elements of \nthe frame packing arrangement SEI message. In Figure D-1 to Figure D-10, an upconversion processing is performed on each \nconstituent frame to produce frames having the same resolution as that of the decoded frame. An example of the upsampling method \nto be applied to a quincunx sampled frame as shown in Figure D-1 or Figure D-10 is to fill in missing positions with an average of \nthe available spatially neighbouring samples (the average of the values of the available samples above, below, to the left and to the \nright of each sample to be generated). The actual upconversion process to be performed, if any, is outside the scope of this \nSpecification. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The sample aspect ratio (SAR) indicated in the VUI parameters should indicate the output picture shape for the packed \ndecoded frame output by a decoder that does not interpret the frame packing arrangement SEI message. In the examples shown in \nFigure D-1 to Figure D-10, the SAR produced in each upconverted colour plane would be the same as the SAR indicated in the VUI \nparameters, since the illustrated upconversion process produces the same total number of samples from each constituent frame as \nexisted in the packed decoded frame. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When the output time of the samples of constituent frame 0 differs from the output time of the samples of constituent \nframe 1 (i.e., when field_views_flag is equal to 1 or frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 5) and the display system in use \npresents two views simultaneously, the display time for constituent frame 0 should be delayed to coincide with the display time for \nconstituent frame 1. (The display process is not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard.) \n \n\nNOTE 4 \u2013 When  field_views_flag  is  equal  to  1  or  frame_packing_arrangement_type  is  equal  to  5,  the  value  0  for \nfixed_frame_rate_flag is not expected to be prevalent in industry use of this SEI message. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 frame_packing_arrangement_type equal to 5 describes a temporal interleaving process of different views. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 Figure D-12 provides an illustration of the rearrangement process for the frame packing arrangement scheme for the \nframe_packing_arrangement_type value of 7. \nAll other values of frame_packing_arrangement_type are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. It is a requirement \nof bitstream conformance that the bitstreams shall not contain such other values of frame_packing_arrangement_type. \nquincunx_sampling_flag equal to 1 indicates that each colour component plane of each constituent frame is quincunx \nsampled as illustrated in Figure D-1 or Figure D-10, and quincunx_sampling_flag equal to 0 indicates that the colour \ncomponent planes of each constituent frame are not quincunx sampled. \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that quincunx_\nsampling_flag shall be equal to 1. When frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 5, 6, or 7, it is a requirement of \nbitstream conformance that quincunx_sampling_flag shall be equal to 0. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 For any chroma format (4:2:0, 4:2:2, or 4:4:4), the luma plane and each chroma plane is quincunx sampled as illustrated \nin Figure D-1 when quincunx_sampling_flag is equal to 1. \nLet croppedWidth and croppedHeight be the width and height, respectively, of the cropped frame area output from the \ndecoder in units of luma samples, derived as follows: \ncroppedWidth = PicWidthInSamples  \u2212 CropUnitX * ( frame_crop_left_offset + frame_crop_right_offset ) \nL\n        (D-30) \ncroppedHeight = 16 * FrameHeightInMbs \u2212 CropUnitY * ( frame_crop_top_offset + frame_crop_bottom_offset ) \n        (D-31) \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 7, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that croppedWidth and \ncroppedHeight shall be integer multiples of 3. \nLet oneThirdWidth and oneThirdHeight be derived as follows: \noneThirdWidth = croppedWidth / 3    (D-32) \noneThirdHeight = croppedHeight / 3    (D-33) \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 7, the frame packing arrangement is composed of five rectangular \nregions identified as R0, R1, R2, R3, and R4 as illustrated in Figure D-12. \nThe width and height of region R0 are specified in units of frame luma samples as follows: \nr0  = 2 * oneThirdWidth    (D-34) \nW\nr0  = 2* oneThirdHeight    (D-35) \nH\nThe width and height of region R1 are specified in units of frame luma samples as follows: \nr1  = oneThirdWidth    (D-36) \nW\nr1  = 2* oneThirdHeight    (D-37) \nH\nThe width and height of region R2 are specified in units of frame luma samples as follows: \nr2  = oneThirdWidth    (D-38) \nW\nr2  = oneThirdHeight    (D-39) \nH\nThe width and height of region R3 are specified in units of frame luma samples as follows: \nr3  = oneThirdWidth    (D-40) \nW\nr3  = oneThirdHeight    (D-41) \nH\nThe width and height of region R4 are specified in units of frame luma samples as follows: \n \n\nr4  = oneThirdWidth    (D-42) \nW\nr4  = oneThirdHeight    (D-43) \nH\nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 7, constituent frame 0 is obtained by cropping from the decoded frames \nregion R0, and constituent frame 1 is obtained by stacking vertically regions R2 and R3 and placing the resulting rectangle \nto the right of the region R1. Region R4 is not part of either constituent frame and is discarded. \ncontent_interpretation_type indicates the intended interpretation of the constituent frames as specified in Table D-10. \nValues of content_interpretation_type that do not appear in Table D-10 are reserved for future specification by ITU-T | \nISO/IEC. When frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 6, content_interpretation_type shall be equal to 0. \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is not equal to 6, for each specified frame packing arrangement scheme, there are \ntwo constituent frames that are referred to as frame 0 and frame 1. \nTable D-10 \u2013 Definition of content_interpretation_type \nValue  Interpretation \n0  Unspecified relationship between the frame packed constituent frames \n1  Indicates that the two constituent frames form the left and right views of a stereo view scene, with frame 0 \nbeing associated with the left view and frame 1 being associated with the right view \n2  Indicates that the two constituent frames form the right and left views of a stereo view scene, with frame 0 \nbeing associated with the right view and frame 1 being associated with the left view \n \nNOTE 8 \u2013 The value 2 for content_interpretation_type is not expected to be prevalent in industry use of this SEI message. However, \nthe value was specified herein for purposes of completeness. \nWhen  frame_packing_arrangement_type  is  equal  to  6,  content_interpretation_type,  frame0_self_contained_flag, \nframe1_self_contained_flag,  frame0_grid_position_x,  frame0_grid_position_y,  frame1_grid_position_x,  and \nframe1_grid_position_y have no meaning and shall be equal to 0, and decoders shall ignore the values of these syntax \nelements. In this case, semantics for other values of these syntax elements are reserved for future specification by ITU-T | \nISO/IEC. \nspatial_flipping_flag equal to 1, when frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 3 or 4, indicates that one of the two \nconstituent frames is spatially flipped relative to its intended orientation for display or other such purposes. \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 3 or 4 and spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 1, the type of spatial flipping \nthat is indicated is as follows: \n\u2013  If frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 3, the indicated spatial flipping is horizontal flipping. \n\u2013  Otherwise (frame_packing_arrangement_type is equal to 4), the indicated spatial flipping is vertical flipping. \nWhen frame_packing_arrangement_type is not equal to 3 or 4, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that \nspatial_flipping_flag shall be equal to 0. When frame_packing_arrangement_type is not equal to 3 or 4, the value 1 for \nspatial_flipping_flag is reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. When frame_packing_arrangement_type is not equal \nto 3 or 4, decoders shall ignore the value 1 for spatial_flipping_flag. \nframe0_flipped_flag, when spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 1, indicates which one of the two constituent frames is flipped. \nWhen spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 1, frame0_flipped_flag equal to 0 indicates that frame 0 is not spatially flipped and \nframe 1 is spatially flipped, and frame0_flipped_flag equal to 1 indicates that frame 0 is spatially flipped and frame 1 is \nnot spatially flipped. \nWhen spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 0, it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that frame0_flipped_flag shall be \nequal to 0. When spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 0, the value 1 for spatial_flipping_flag is reserved for future use by ITU-\nT | ISO/IEC. When spatial_flipping_flag is equal to 0, decoders shall ignore the value of frame0_flipped_flag. \nfield_views_flag equal to 1 indicates that all pictures in the current coded video sequence are coded as complementary \nfield pairs.  All fields of a particular parity are considered a first constituent frame and all fields of the opposite parity are \nconsidered a second constituent frame.  When frame_packing_arrangement_type is not equal to 2, it is a requirement of \nbitstream conformance that the field_views_flag shall be equal to 0.

The decoded picture should be rotated \nby  360 * anticlockwise_rotation \u00f7 216  degrees  (2 * \u03c0 * anticlockwise_rotation \u00f7 216  radians,  where  \u03c0  is  Archimedes' \nConstant (3.141 592 653 589 793 \u2026) in the anticlockwise direction prior to display. For example, anticlockwise_rotation \nequal to 0 indicates no rotation and anticlockwise_rotation equal to 16 384 indicates 90 degrees (\u03c0 \u00f7 2 radians) rotation in \nthe anticlockwise direction. \nNOTE \u2013 It is possible for equivalent transformations to be expressed in multiple ways using these syntax elements.

The described mastering display is a three-colour additive display system \nthat has been configured to use the indicated mastering colour volume. \nThis SEI message does not specify the measurement methodologies and procedures used for determining the indicated \nvalues or any description of the mastering environment. It also does not provide information on colour transformations \nthat would be appropriate to preserve creative intent on displays with colour volumes different from that of the described \nmastering display. \nThe information conveyed in this SEI message is intended to be adequate for purposes corresponding to the use of Society \nof Motion Picture and Television Engineers ST 2086. \nWhen a mastering display colour volume SEI message is present in any access unit of a coded video sequence, a mastering \ndisplay colour volume SEI message shall be present in the IDR access unit that is the first access unit of the coded video \nsequence. All mastering display colour volume SEI messages that apply to the same coded video sequence shall have the \nsame content. \nThe mastering display colour volume SEI message persists in decoding order from the current access unit until the end of \nthe coded video sequence. \ndisplay_primaries_x[ c ], when in the range of 5 to 37 000, inclusive, specifies the normalized x chromaticity coordinate \nof the colour primary component c of the mastering display, according to the CIE 1931 definition of x as specified in ISO \n11664-1 (see also ISO 11664-3 and CIE 15), in increments of 0.00002. When display_primaries_x[ c ] is not in the range \nof 5 to 37 000, inclusive, the normalized x chromaticity coordinate of the colour primary component c of the mastering \ndisplay is unknown or unspecified or specified by other means not specified in this Specification. \ndisplay_primaries_y[ c ], when in the range of 5 to 42 000, inclusive, specifies the normalized y chromaticity coordinate \nof the colour primary component c of the mastering display, according to the CIE 1931 definition of y as specified in ISO \n11664-1 (see also ISO 11664-3 and CIE 15), in increments of 0.00002. When display_primaries_y[ c ] is not in the range \nof 5 to 42 000, inclusive, the normalized y chromaticity coordinate of the colour primary component c of the mastering \ndisplay is unknown or unspecified or specified by other means not specified in this Specification. \nFor describing mastering displays that use red, green, and blue colour primaries, it is suggested that index value c equal to \n0 should correspond to the green primary, c equal to 1 should correspond to the blue primary and c equal to 2 should \ncorrespond to the red colour primary (see also Annex E and Table E-3). \nwhite_point_x, when in the range of 5 to 37 000, inclusive, specifies the normalized x chromaticity coordinate of the white \npoint of the mastering display, according to the CIE 1931 definition of x as specified in ISO 11664-1 (see also ISO 11664-\n3 and CIE 15), in normalized increments of 0.00002.

When white_point_y is not in the range of 5 to 42 000, inclusive, the \nnormalized y chromaticity coordinate of the white point of the mastering display is indicated to be unknown or unspecified \nor specified by other means not specified in this Specification. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ST 2086 (2018) specifies that the normalized x and y chromaticity \ncoordinate values for the mastering display colour primaries and white point are to be represented with four decimal places. This \nwould correspond with using values of the syntax elements display_primaries_x[ c ], display_primaries_y[ c ], white_point_x, and \nwhite_point_y, as defined in this Specification, that are multiples of 5. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 An example of the use of values outside the range for which semantics are specified in this Specification is that \nANSI/CTA 861-G (2016) uses normalized (x, y) chromaticity coordinate values of (0,0) for the white point to indicate that the white \npoint chromaticity is unknown. \nmax_display_mastering_luminance, when in the range of 50 000 to 100 000 000, specifies the nominal maximum \ndisplay  luminance  of  the  mastering  display  in  units  of  0.0001  candelas  per  square  metre.  When \nmax_display_mastering_luminance is not in the range of 50 000 to 100 000 000, the nominal maximum display luminance \nof the mastering display is indicated to be unknown or unspecified or specified by other means not specified in this \nSpecification. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ST 2086 (2018) specifies that the nominal maximum display \nluminance of the mastering display is to be specified as a multiple of 1 candela per square meter. This would correspond with using \nvalues of the syntax element max_display_mastering_luminance, as defined in this Specification, that are a multiple of 10 000. \n \n\nNOTE 4 \u2013 An example of the use of values outside the range for which semantics are specified in this Specification is that \nANSI/CTA 861-G (2016) uses the value 0 for the nominal maximum display luminance of the mastering display to indicate that the \nnominal maximum display luminance of the mastering display is unknown. \nmin_display_mastering_luminance, when in the range of 1 to 50 000, specifies the nominal minimum display luminance \nof the mastering display in units of 0.0001 candelas per square metre. When min_display_mastering_luminance is not in \nthe range of 1 to 50 000, the nominal maximum display luminance of the mastering display is unknown or unspecified or \nspecified by other means not specified in this Specification. When max_display_mastering_luminance is equal to 50 000, \nmin_display_mastering_luminance shall not be equal to 50 000. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ST 2086 (2018) specifies that the nominal minimum display \nluminance of the mastering display is to be specified as a multiple of 0.0001 candelas per square metre, which corresponds to the \nsemantics specified in this Specification. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 An example of the use of values outside the range for which semantics are specified in this Specification is that \nANSI/CTA 861-G (2016) uses the value 0 for the nominal minimum display luminance of the mastering display to indicate that the \nnominal minimum display luminance of the mastering display is unknown. \nNOTE 7 \u2013 Another example of the potential use of values outside the range for which semantics are specified in this Specification \nis that Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers ST 2086 (2018) indicates that values outside the specified range could \nbe used to indicate that the black level and contrast of the mastering display have been adjusted using picture line-up generation \nequipment (PLUGE). \nAt the minimum luminance, the mastering display is considered to have the same nominal chromaticity as the white point. \nD.2.30  Colour remapping information SEI message semantics \nThe colour remapping information SEI message provides information to enable remapping of the reconstructed colour \nsamples of the output pictures for purposes such as converting the output pictures to a representation that is more suitable \nfor an alternative display. The colour remapping model used in the colour remapping information SEI message is composed \nof a first piece-wise linear function applied to each colour component (specified by the \"pre\" set of syntax elements herein), \nfollowed by a three-by-three matrix applied to the three resulting colour components, followed by a second piece-wise \nlinear function applied to each resulting colour component (specified by the \"post\" set of syntax elements herein). \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Colour remapping of the output pictures for the display process (which is outside the scope of this Specification) is \noptional and does not affect the decoding process specified in this Specification. \nUnless indicated otherwise by some means not specified in this Specification, the input to the indicated remapping process \nis the set of decoded sample values after applying an (unspecified) upsampling conversion process to the 4:4:4 colour \nsampling format as necessary when the colour remapping three-by-three matrix coefficients are present in the SEI message \nand chroma_format_idc is equal to 1 (4:2:0 chroma format) or 2 (4:2:2 chroma format). When chroma_format_idc is equal \nto 0 (monochrome), the colour remapping information SEI message shall not be present, although decoders shall allow \nsuch messages to be present and shall ignore any such colour remapping information SEI messages that may be present. \ncolour_remap_id contains an identifying number that may be used to identify the purpose of the colour remapping \ninformation. The value of colour_remap_id may be used (in a manner not specified in this Specification) to indicate that \nthe input to the remapping process is the output of some conversion process that is not specified in this Specification, such \nas a conversion of the picture to some alternative colour representation (e.g., conversion from a YCbCr colour \nrepresentation to a GBR colour representation). When more than one colour remapping information SEI message is present \nwith the same value of colour_remap_id, the content of these colour remapping information SEI messages shall be the \nsame. When colour remapping information SEI messages are present that have more than one value of colour_remap_id, \nthis may indicate that the remapping processes indicated by the different values of colour_remap_id are alternatives that \nare provided for different purposes or that a cascading of remapping processes is to be applied in a sequential order (an \norder that is not specified in this Specification). The value of colour_remap_id shall be in the range of 0 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive. \nValues of colour_remap_id from 0 to 255, inclusive, and from 512 to 231 \u2212 1, inclusive, may be used as determined by the \napplication. Values of colour_remap_id from 256 to 511, inclusive, and from 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, are reserved for \nfuture use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of colour_remap_id in the range of 256 to 511, inclusive, \nor in the range of 231 to 232 \u2212 2, inclusive, shall ignore it. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The colour_remap_id can be used to support different colour remapping processes that are suitable for different display \nscenarios. For example, different values of colour_remap_id may correspond to different remapped colour spaces supported by \ndisplays. \ncolour_remap_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the colour remapping information SEI  message cancels the \npersistence of any previous colour remapping information SEI message in output order that applies to the current layer. \ncolour_remap_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that colour remapping information follows. \ncolour_remap_repetition_period specifies the persistence of the colour remapping information SEI message and may \nspecify a picture order count interval within which another colour remapping information SEI message with the same value \nof  colour_remap_id  or  the  end  of  the  coded  video  sequence  shall  be  present  in  the  bitstream.  The  value  of \ncolour_remap_repetition_period shall be in the range of 0 to 16 384, inclusive. \n \n\ncolour_remap_repetition_period equal to 0 specifies that the colour remapping information applies to the current decoded \npicture only. \ncolour_remap_repetition_period equal to 1 specifies that the colour remapping information persists in output order until \nany of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a colour remapping information SEI message with the same value of \ncolour_remap_id is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ). \ncolour_remap_repetition_period equal to 0 or equal to 1 indicates that another colour remapping information SEI message \nwith the same value of colour_remap_id may or may not be present. \ncolour_remap_repetition_period greater than 1 specifies that the colour remapping information persists until any of the \nfollowing conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence begins. \n\u2013  A picture in an access unit containing a colour remapping information SEI message with the same value of \ncolour_remap_id is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater than PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to \nPicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + colour_remap_repetition_period. \ncolour_remap_repetition_period greater than 1 indicates that another colour remapping information SEI message with the \nsame value of colour_remap_id shall be present for a picture in an access unit that is output having PicOrderCnt( ) greater \nthan PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) and less than or equal to PicOrderCnt( CurrPic ) + colour_remap_repetition_period; unless \nthe bitstream ends or a new coded video sequence begins without output of such a picture. \ncolour_remap_video_signal_info_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that syntax elements colour_remap_full_range_flag, \ncolour_remap_primaries,  colour_remap_transfer_function  and  colour_remap_matrix_coefficients  are  present, \ncolour_remap_video_signal_info_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that syntax elements colour_remap_full_range_flag, \ncolour_remap_primaries, colour_remap_transfer_function and colour_remap_matrix_coefficients are not present. \ncolour_remap_full_range_flag has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the video_full_range_flag syntax \nelement, except that colour_remap_full_range_flag identifies the colour space of the remapped reconstructed picture, rather \nthan the colour space used for the coded video sequence. When not present, the value of colour_remap_full_range_flag is \ninferred to be equal to the value of video_full_range_flag. \ncolour_remap_primaries has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the colour_primaries syntax element, \nexcept that colour_remap_primaries identifies the colour space of the remapped reconstructed picture, rather than the \ncolour space used for the coded video sequence. When not present, the value of colour_remap_primaries is inferred to be \nequal to the value of colour_primaries. \ncolour_remap_transfer_function has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the transfer_characteristics \nsyntax element, except that colour_remap_transfer_function identifies the colour space of the remapped reconstructed \npicture,  rather  than  the  colour  space  used  for  the  coded  video  sequence.  When  not  present,  the  value  of \ncolour_remap_transfer_function is inferred to be equal to the value of transfer_characteristics. \ncolour_remap_matrix_coefficients has the same semantics as specified in clause E.2.1 for the matrix_coefficients syntax \nelement, except that colour_remap_matrix_coefficients identifies the colour space of the remapped reconstructed picture, \nrather  than  the  colour  space  used  for  the  coded  video  sequence.

When any colour remapping information SEI messages \nis present with the value of colour_remap_input_bit_depth not equal to the bit depth of the decoded colour components, \nthe SEI message refers to the hypothetical result of a conversion operation performed to convert the decoded colour \ncomponent samples to the bit depth equal to colour_remap_input_bit_depth. \nThe  value  of  colour_remap_input_bit_depth  shall  be  in  the  range  of  8  to  16,  inclusive.  Values  of \ncolour_remap_input_bit_depth from 0 to 7, inclusive, and from 17 to 255, inclusive, are reserved for future use by ITU-T \n| ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore all colour remapping SEI messages that contain a colour_remap_input_bit_depth in the \nrange of 0 to 7, inclusive, or in the range of 17 to 255, inclusive, and bitstreams shall not contain such values. \ncolour_remap_output_bit_depth specifies the bit depth of the output of the colour remapping function described by the \ncolour remapping information SEI message. \nThe  value  of  colour_remap_output_bit_depth  shall  be  in  the  range  of  8  to  16,  inclusive.  Values  of \ncolour_remap_output_bit_depth from 0 to 7, inclusive, and in the range of 17 to 255, inclusive, are reserved for future use \nby  ITU-T  |  ISO/IEC.

When pre_lut_num_val_minus1[ c ] is equal to 0, the default end points \nof the input values are 0 and 2colour_remap_input_bit_depth \u2212 1, and the corresponding default end points of the output values are 0 \nand 2colour_remap_output_bit_depth \u2212 1, for the c-th component. In bitstreams conforming to this version of this Specification, the \nvalue of pre_lut_num_val_minus1[ c ] shall be in the range of 0 to 32, inclusive. \npre_lut_coded_value[ c ][ i ] specifies the value of the i-th pivot point for the c-th component. The number of bits used \nto represent pre_lut_coded_value[ c ][ i ] is ( ( colour_remap_input_bit_depth + 7 )  >>  3 )  <<  3. \npre_lut_target_value[ c ][ i ] specifies the value of the i-th pivot point for the c-th component.

When not present, the value of log2_matrix_denom is \ninferred to be equal to 0. \ncolour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ i ] specifies the value of the three-by-three colour remapping matrix coefficients. The value of \ncolour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ i ] shall be in the range of \u2212215 to 215 \u2212 1, inclusive. When colour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ i ] is not \npresent, it is inferred to be equal to 1 if c is equal to i, and inferred to be equal to 0 otherwise. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When colour_remap_matrix_present_flag is equal to 0, the colour remapping matrix is inferred to be equal to the identity \nmatrix of size 3x3. \nThe variable matrixOutput[ c ] for c = 0, 1 and 2 is derived as follows: \nroundingOffset = log2_matrix_denom  = =  0 ? 0: 1  <<  ( log2_matrix_denom \u2212 1 ) \nmatrixOutput[ c ] = Clip3( 0, ( 1  <<  colour_remap_output_bit_depth ) \u2212 1,   (D-44) \n  ( colour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ 0 ] * matrixInput[ 0 ] + colour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ 1 ] * matrixInput[ 1 ] \n  + colour_remap_coeffs[ c ][ 2 ] * matrixInput[ 2 ] + roundingOffset )  >>  log2_matrix_denom )   \nwhere matrixInput[ c ] is the input sample value of the c-th colour component,and matrixOutput[ c ] is the output sample \nvalue of the c-th colour component. \npost_lut_num_val_minus1[ c ] has the same semantics as pre_lut_num_val_minus1[ c ], with pre replaced by post, except \nthat the default end points of the input values are 0 and 2colour_remap_output_bit_depth \u2212 1 for the c-th colour component. The value \nof post_lut_num_val_minus1[ c ] shall be in the range of 0 to 32, inclusive. \npost_lut_coded_value[ c ][ i ] has the same semantics as pre_lut_coded_value[ c ][ i ], with \"pre\" replaced by \"post\", \nexcept  that  the  number  of  bits  used  to  represent  post_lut_coded_value[ c ][ i ]  is \n( ( colour_remap_output_bit_depth + 7 )  >>  3 )  <<  3. \npost_lut_target_value[ c ][ i ] has the same semantics as pre_lut_target_value[ c ][ i ], with \"pre\" replaced by \"post\" \nexcept that colour_remap_input_bit_depth is replaced by colour_remap_output_bit_depth in the semantics. \nD.2.31  Content light level information SEI message semantics \nThis SEI message identifies upper bounds for the nominal target brightness light level of the pictures of the coded video \nsequence. \nThe information conveyed in this SEI message is intended to be adequate for purposes corresponding to the use of the \nConsumer Technology Association 861.3 specification. \n \n\nThe semantics of the content light level information SEI message are defined in relation to the values of samples in a 4:4:4 \nrepresentation of red, green, and blue colour primary intensities in the linear light domain for the pictures of the coded \nvideo sequence, in units of candelas per square metre. However, this SEI message does not, by itself, identify a conversion \nprocess for converting the sample values of a decoded picture to the samples in a 4:4:4 representation of red, green, and \nblue colour primary intensities in the linear light domain for the picture. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Other  syntax  elements,  such  as  colour_primaries,  transfer_characteristics,  matrix_coefficients,  and  the  chroma \nresampling filter hint SEI message, when present, may assist in the identification of such a conversion process. \nGiven the red, green, and blue colour primary intensities in the linear light domain for the location of a luma sample in a \ncorresponding 4:4:4 representation, denoted as E , E , and E , the maximum component intensity is defined as E  = \nR G B Max\nMax( E , Max( E , E  ) ). The light level corresponding to the stimulus is then defined as the CIE 1931 luminance \nR G B\ncorresponding to equal amplitudes of E  for all three colour primary intensities for red, green, and blue (with appropriate \nMax\nscaling to reflect the nominal luminance level associated with peak white \u2013 e.g., ordinarily scaling to associate peak white \nwith 10 000 candelas per square metre when transfer_characteristics is equal to 16). \nNOTE 2 \u2013 Since the maximum value EMax is used in this definition at each sample location, rather than a direct conversion from ER, \nEG, and EB to the corresponding CIE 1931 luminance, the CIE 1931 luminance at a location may in some cases be less than the \nindicated light level. This situation would occur, for example, when ER and EG are very small and EB is large, in which case the \nindicated light level would be much larger than the true CIE 1931 luminance associated with the ( ER, EG, EB ) triplet. \nWhen a content light level information SEI message is present in any access unit of a coded video sequence, a content light \nlevel information SEI message shall be present in the IDR access unit that is the first access unit of the coded video \nsequence. All content light level information SEI messages that apply to the same coded video sequence shall have the \nsame content. \nThe content light level information SEI message persists in decoding order from the current access unit until the end of the \ncoded video sequence. \nmax_content_light_level, when not equal to 0, indicates an upper bound on the maximum light level among all individual \nsamples in a 4:4:4 representation of red, green, and blue colour primary intensities (in the linear light domain) for the \npictures of the coded video sequence, in units of candelas per square metre. When equal to 0, no such upper bound is \nindicated by max_content_light_level. \nmax_pic_average_light_level, when not equal to 0, indicates an upper bound on the maximum average light level among \nthe samples in a 4:4:4 representation of red, green, and blue colour primary intensities (in the linear light domain) for any \nindividual picture of the coded video sequence, in units of candelas per square metre. When equal to 0, no such upper \nbound is indicated by max_pic_average_light_level. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When the visually relevant region does not correspond to the entire cropped decoded picture, such as for \"letterbox\" \nencoding of video content with a wide picture aspect ratio within a taller cropped decoded picture, the indicated average should be \nperformed only within the visually relevant region. \nD.2.32  Alternative transfer characteristics SEI message semantics \nThe alternative transfer characteristics SEI message provides a preferred alternative value for the transfer_characteristics \nsyntax element that is indicated by the colour description syntax of VUI parameters of the sequence parameter set. This \nSEI message is intended to be used in cases when some value of transfer_characteristics is preferred for interpretation of \nthe pictures of the coded video sequence although some other value of transfer_characteristics may also be acceptable for \ninterpretation of the pictures of the coded video sequence and that other value is provided in the colour description syntax \nof VUI parameters of the sequence parameter set for interpretation by decoders that do not support interpretation of the \npreferred value (e.g., because the preferred value had not yet been defined in a previous version of this Specification). \nWhen an alternative transfer characteristics SEI message is present for any picture of a coded video sequence, an alternative \ntransfer characteristics SEI message shall be present for the IDR picture of the coded video sequence. The alternative \ntransfer characteristics SEI message persists in decoding order from the current picture until the end of the coded video \nsequence. All alternative transfer characteristics SEI messages that apply to the same coded video sequence shall have the \nsame content. \npreferred_transfer_characteristics specifies a preferred alternative value for the transfer_characteristics syntax element \nof  the  colour  description  syntax  of  VUI  parameters  of  the  sequence  parameter  set.  The  semantics  for \npreferred_transfer_characteristics are otherwise the same as for the transfer_characteristics syntax element specified in the \nVUI parameters of the sequence parameter set (see clause E.2.1 and Table E-4). When preferred_transfer_characteristics \nis not equal to the value of transfer_characteristics indicated in the VUI parameters of the sequence parameter set, decoders \nshould ignore the value of transfer_characteristics indicated in the VUI parameters of the sequence parameter set and \ninstead use the value indicated by preferred_transfer_characteristics. \nD.2.33  Content colour volume SEI message semantics \nThe content colour volume SEI message describes the colour volume characteristics of the associated pictures. These \ncolour volume characteristics are expressed in terms of a nominal range, although deviations from this range may occur. \n \n\nThe variable transferCharacteristics is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If an alternative transfer characteristics SEI message is present for the coded video sequence, transferCharacteristics \nis set equal to preferred_transfer_characteristics; \n\u2013  Otherwise, (an alternative transfer characteristics SEI message is not present for the coded video sequence), \ntransferCharacteristics is set equal to transfer_characteristics. \nThe content colour volume SEI message shall not be present, and decoders shall ignore it, when any of the following \nconditions is true: \n\u2013  Any of the values of transferCharacteristics, colour_primaries, and matrix_coefficients has a value defined as \nunspecified. \n\u2013  The value of transfer_characteristics is equal to 2, 4, or 5. \n\u2013  The value of colour_primaries is equal to 2. \nThe following applies when converting the signal from a non-linear to a linear representation: \n\u2013  If the value of transferCharacteristics is equal to 1, 6, 7, 14, or 15, the Rec. ITU-R BT.1886-0 reference electro-optical \ntransfer function should be used to convert the signal to its linear representation, where the value of screen luminance \nfor white is set equal to 100 cd/m2, the value of screen luminance for black is set equal to 0 cd/m2, and the value of \nthe exponent of the power function is set equal to 2.4. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the value of transferCharacteristics is equal to 18, the hybrid log-gamma reference electro-optical \ntransfer function specified in Rec. ITU-R BT.2100-2 should be used to convert the signal to its linear representation, \nwhere the value of nominal peak luminance of the display is set equal to 1000 cd/m2, the value of the display \nluminance for black is set equal to 0 cd/m2, and the value of system gamma is set equal to 1.2. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the value of transferCharacteristics is not equal to 1, 6, 7, 14, 15, or 18) when the content colour volume \nSEI message is present, the exact inverse of the transfer function specified in Table E-4 should be used to convert the \nnon-linear signal to a linear representation. \nccv_cancel_flag equal to 1 indicates that the content colour volume SEI message cancels the persistence of any previous \ncontent colour volume SEI message in output order. ccv_cancel_flag equal to 0 indicates that content colour volume \ninformation follows. \nccv_persistence_flag specifies the persistence of the content colour volume SEI message. \nccv_persistence_flag equal to 0 specifies that the content colour volume SEI message applies to the current decoded picture \nonly. \nLet picA be the current picture. ccv_persistence_flag equal to 1 specifies that the content colour volume SEI message \npersists in output order until one or more of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new CVS begins. \n\u2013  The bitstream ends. \n\u2013  A picture picB in an access unit containing a content colour volume SEI message is output having PicOrderCnt( picB ) \ngreater than PicOrderCnt( picA ). \nccv_primaries_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that the syntax elements ccv_primaries_x[ c ] and ccv_primaries_y[ c ] \nare  present.  ccv_primaries_present_flag  equal  to  0  specifies  that  the  syntax  elements  ccv_primaries_x[ c ]  and \nccv_primaries_y[ c ] are not present. \nccv_min_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that the syntax element ccv_min_luminance_value is \npresent. ccv_min_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that the syntax element ccv_min_luminance_value \nis not present. \nccv_max_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that the syntax element ccv_max_luminance_value is \npresent. ccv_max_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that the syntax element ccv_max_luminance_value \nis not present. \nccv_avg_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that the syntax element ccv_avg_luminance_value is \npresent. ccv_avg_luminance_value_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that the syntax element ccv_avg_luminance_value is \nnot present. \nIt  is  a  requirement  of  bitstream  conformance  that  the  values  of  ccv_primaries_present_flag, \nccv_min_luminance_value_present_flag,  ccv_max_luminance_value_present_flag,  and \nccv_avg_luminance_value_present_flag shall not all be equal to 0. \n \n\nccv_reserved_zero_2bits shall be equal to 0 in bitstreams conforming to this version of this Specification. Other values \nfor ccv_reserved_zero_2bits are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore the value of \nccv_reserved_zero_2bits. \nccv_primaries_x[ c ] and ccv_primaries_y[ c ] specify the normalized x and y chromaticity coordinates, respectively, of \nthe colour primary component c of the nominal content colour volume in normalized increments of 0.00002, according to \nthe CIE 1931 definition of x and y as specified in ISO 11664-1 (see also ISO 11664-3 and CIE 15), in normalized \nincrements of 0.00002. For describing colour volumes that use red, green, and blue colour primaries, it is suggested that \nindex value c equal to 0 should correspond to the green primary, c equal to 1 should correspond to the blue primary, and c \nequal to 2 should correspond to the red colour primary (see also Annex E and Table E-3). \nThe values of ccv_primaries_x[ c ] and ccv_primaries_y[ c ] shall be in the range of \u22125 000 000 to 5 000 000, inclusive. \nWhen ccv_primaries_x[ c ] and ccv_primaries_y[ c ] are not present, they are inferred to be equal to the normalized x and \ny chromaticity coordinates, respectively, specified by colour_primaries. \nccv_min_luminance_value specifies the normalized minimum luminance value, according to CIE 1931, that is expected \nto be present in the content, where values are normalized to L  or L as specified in Table E-4 according to the indicated \no c\ntransfer characteristics of the signal. The values of ccv_min_luminance_value are in normalized increments of 0.0000001. \nccv_max_luminance_value specifies the maximum luminance value, according to CIE 1931, that is expected to be present \nin the content, where values are normalized to L  or L as specified in Table E-4 according to the transfer characteristics \no c\nof the signal. The values of ccv_max_luminance_value are in normalized increments of 0.0000001. \nccv_avg_luminance_value specifies the average luminance value, according to CIE 1931, that is expected to be present \nin the content, where values are normalized to L  or L as specified in Table E-4 according to the transfer characteristics \no c\nof the signal. The values of ccv_avg_luminance_value are in normalized increments of 0.0000001. \nNOTE \u2013 The resulting domain from this conversion process may or may not represent light in a source or display domain \u2013 it is \nmerely a gamut representation domain rather than necessarily being a representation of actual light in either the scene or display \ndomain.  Therefore,  the  values  corresponding  to  ccv_min_luminance_value,  ccv_max_luminance_value,  and \nccv_avg_luminance_value might not necessarily correspond to a true luminance value. \nThe value of ccv_min_luminance_value, when present, shall be less than or equal to ccv_avg_luminance_value, when \npresent. The value of ccv_avg_luminance_value, when present, shall be less than or equal to ccv_max_luminance_value, \nwhen  present.  The  value  of  ccv_min_luminance_value,  when  present,  shall  be  less  than  or  equal  to \nccv_max_luminance_value, when present. \nWhen the visually relevant region does not correspond to the entire cropped decoded picture, such as for \"letterbox\" \nencoding of video content with a wide picture aspect ratio within a taller cropped decoded picture, the indicated \nccv_min_luminance_value, ccv_max_luminance_value, and ccv_avg_luminance_value should correspond only to values \nwithin the visually relevant region. \nD.2.34  Ambient viewing environment SEI message semantics \nThe ambient viewing environment SEI message identifies the characteristics of the nominal ambient viewing environment \nfor the display of the associated video content. The syntax elements of the ambient viewing environment SEI message may \nassist the receiving system in adapting the received video content for local display in viewing environments that may be \nsimilar or may substantially differ from those assumed or intended when mastering the video content. \nThis SEI message does not provide information on colour transformations that would be appropriate to preserve creative \nintent on displays with colour volumes different from that of the described mastering display. \nWhen an ambient viewing environment SEI message is present for any picture of a coded video sequence, an ambient \nviewing environment SEI message shall be present in the IDR access unit that is the first access unit of the coded video \nsequence. All ambient viewing environment SEI messages that apply to the same coded video sequence shall have the \nsame content. \nambient_illuminance specifies the environmental illluminance of the ambient viewing environment in units of 0.0001 \nlux. ambient_illuminance shall not be equal to 0. \nambient_light_x and ambient_light_y specify the normalized x and y chromaticity coordinates, respectively, of the \nenvironmental ambient light in the nominal viewing environment, according to the CIE 1931 definition of x and y as \nspecified in ISO 11664-1 (see also ISO 11664-3 and CIE 15), in normalized increments of 0.00002.

Values of \nomni_viewport_id from 512 to 1023 are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders encountering a value of \nomni_viewport_id in the range of 512 to 1023, inclusive, shall ignore it. \nomni_viewport_cancel_flag  equal  to  1  indicates  that  the  SEI  message  cancels  the  persistence  of  any  previous \nomnidirectional  viewport  SEI  message  in  output  order.  omni_viewport_cancel_flag  equal  to  0  indicates  that \nomnidirectional viewport information follows. \nomni_viewport_persistence_flag specifies the persistence of the omnidirectional viewport SEI message. \nomni_viewport_persistence_flag equal to 0 specifies that the omnidirectional viewport SEI message applies to the current \ndecoded picture only. \nLet picA be the current picture. omni_viewport_persistence_flag equal to 1 specifies that the omnidirectional viewport SEI \nmessage persists in output order until one or more of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  A new coded video sequence (CVS) begins. \n\u2013  The bitstream ends. \n\u2013  A  picture  picB  in  an  access  unit  containing  an  omnidirectional  viewport  SEI  message  is  output  having \nPicOrderCnt( picB ) greater than PicOrderCnt( picA ). \nWhen an equirectangular projection SEI message with erp_cancel_flag equal to 0 or a cubemap projection SEI message \nwith cmp_cancel_flag equal to 0 is not present in the CVS that applies to the current picture and precedes the \nomnidirectional  viewport  SEI  message  in  decoding  order,  an  omnidirectional  viewport  SEI  message  with \nomni_viewport_cancel_flag equal to 0 shall not be present in the CVS that applies to the current picture.

The 0-th recommended viewport per director's cut has the highest priority. \n \n\n\uf02d  When omni_viewport_id is equal to 1, between any two recommended viewports, the i-th recommended viewport \nhas higher popularity, among some selection of candidate viewports, than the j-th recommended viewport for any \nvalues of i and j when i is less than j. The 0-th most-viewed recommended viewport has the highest popularity. \nThe selection of the candidate viewports is outside the scope of this Specification. \nomni_viewport_azimuth_centre[ i ]  and  omni_viewport_elevation_centre[ i ]  indicate  the  centre  of  the  i-th \nrecommended  viewport  region,  in  units  of  2\u221216  degrees  relative  to  the  global  coordinate  axes.

The  value  of  omni_viewport_elevation_centre[ i ]  shall  be  in  the  range  of  \u221290 * 216 \n(i.e., \u22125 898 240) to 90 * 216 (i.e., 5 898 240), inclusive. \nomni_viewport_tilt_centre[ i ] indicates the tilt angle of the i-th recommended viewport region, in units of 2\u221216 degrees. \nThe  value  of  omni_viewport_tilt_centre[ i ]  shall  be  in  the  range  of  \u2212180 * 216  (i.e., \u221211 796 480)  to   216 \u2212 1 \n(i.e., 11 796 479), inclusive. \nomni_viewport_hor_range[ i ] indicates the azimuth range of the i-th recommended viewport region, in units of 2\u221216 \ndegrees. The value of omni_viewport_hor_range[ i ] shall be in the range of 1 to 360 * 216 (i.e., 23 592 960), inclusive. \nomni_viewport_ver_range[ i ] indicates the elevation range of the i-th recommended viewport region, in units of 2\u221216 \ndegrees. The value of omni_viewport_ver_range[ i ] shall be in the range of 1 to 180 * 216 (i.e., 11 796 480), inclusive. \nD.2.35.6 Sample location remapping process \nD.2.35.6.1  General \nTo remap colour sample locations of a region-wise packed picture to a unit sphere, the following ordered steps are applied: \n\u2013  A region-wise packed picture is obtained as the cropped decoded picture by decoding a coded picture. For purposes \nof interpretation of chroma samples, the input to the indicated remapping process is the set of decoded sample values \nafter applying an (unspecified) upsampling conversion process to the 4:4:4 colour sampling format as necessary when \nchroma_format_idc is equal to 1 (4:2:0 chroma format) or 2 (4:2:2 chroma format). This (unspecified) upsampling \nprocess should account for the relative positioning relationship between the luma and chroma samples as indicated \nby chroma_sample_loc_type_top_field and chroma_sample_loc_type_bottom_field, when present. \n\u2013  If region-wise packing is indicated, the sample locations of the region-wise packed picture are converted to sample \nlocations of the respective projected picture as specified in clause D.2.35.6.4. Otherwise, the projected picture is \nidentical to the region-wise packed picture. \n\u2013  If frame packing is indicated, the sample locations of the projected picture are converted to sample locations of the \nrespective constituent picture of the projected picture, as specified in clause D.2.35.6.6. Otherwise, the constituent \npicture of the projected picture is identical to the projected picture. \n\u2013  The sample locations of a constituent picture of the projected picture are converted to sphere coordinates relative to \nthe local coordinate axes, as specified in clause D.2.35.6.2. \n\u2013  If rotation is indicated, the sphere coordinates relative to the local coordinate axes are converted to sphere coordinates \nrelative to the global coordinate axes, as specified in clause D.2.35.6.3. Otherwise, the global coordinate axes are \nidentical to the local coordinate axes. \nThe overall process for mapping of luma sample locations within a region-wise packed picture to sphere coordinates \nrelative to the global coordinate axes is normatively specified in clause D.2.35.6.5. \nFor each region-wise packed picture corresponding to a decoded picture, the following applies: \n\u2013  When an equirectangular projection SEI message with erp_cancel_flag equal to 0 that applies to the picture is present, \nErpFlag is set equal to 1, and CmpFlag is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  When a cubemap projection SEI message with cmp_cancel_flag equal to 0 that applies to the picture is present, \nCmpFlag is set equal to 1, and ErpFlag is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  If a sphere rotation SEI message with sphere_rotation_cancel_flag equal to 0 that applies to the picture is present, \nRotationFlag is set equal to 1, and RotationYaw, RotationPitch, and RotationRoll are set equal to yaw_rotation \u00f7 216, \npitch_rotation \u00f7 216, and roll_rotation \u00f7 216, respectively. \n\u2013  Otherwise, RotationFlag is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  If a frame packing arrangement SEI message with frame_packing_arrangement_cancel_flag equal to 0 that applies to \nthe picture is not present, StereoFlag, TopBottomFlag, and SideBySideFlag are all set equal to 0, HorDiv1 is set equal \nto 1, and VerDiv1 is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  StereoFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  If the value of frame_packing_arrangement_type of the frame packing arrangement SEI message is equal to 3, \nTopBottomFlag is set equal to 0, SideBySideFlag is set equal to 1, HorDiv1 is set equal to 2 and VerDiv1 is set \nequal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the value of frame_packing_arrangement_type of the frame packing arrangement SEI message is \nequal to 4, TopBottomFlag is set equal to 1, SideBySideFlag is set equal to 0, HorDiv1 is set equal to 1, and \nVerDiv1 is set equal to 2. \n\u2013  Otherwise, TopBottomFlag is set equal to 0, SideBySideFlag is set equal to 0, HorDiv1 is set equal to 1, and \nVerDiv1 is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  If a region-wise packing SEI message with rwp_cancel_flag equal to 0 that applies to the picture is not present, \nRegionWisePackingFlag is set equal to 0, and ConstituentPicWidth and ConstituentPicHeight are set to be equal to \ncropPicWidth / HorDiv1 and cropPicHeight / VerDiv1, respectively, where cropPicWidth and cropPicHeight are the \nwidth and height, respectively, of the cropped decoded picture. \n\u2013  Otherwise, RegionWisePackingFlag is set equal to 1, and ConstituentPicWidth and ConstituentPicHeight are set equal \nto proj_picture_width / HorDiv1 and proj_picture_height / VerDiv1, respectively. \nD.2.35.6.2  Projection for a sample location \nInputs to this clause are: \n\u2013  pictureWidth and pictureHeight, which are the width and height, respectively, of a

in relative \nprojected picture sample units, where hPos and vPos may have non-integer real values. \nOutputs of this clause are: \n\u2013  sphere coordinates (\u03d5, \u03b8) for the sample location in degrees relative to the coordinate axes specified in clause \nD.2.35.6.1. \nThe projection for a sample location is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If ErpFlag is equal to 1, the following applies: \n\u2013  If RegionWisePackingFlag is equal to 0 and erp_padding_flag is equal to 1, the following applies: \nhPos\u2032 = hPos \u2212 left_gb_erp_width    (D-45) \npictureWidth = pictureWidth \u2212

xProjPicture is set equal to xProjPicture \u2212 proj_picture_width. \n\u2013  When SideBySideFlag is equal to 1, the following applies: \n\u2013  When ProjRegionLeft[ n ] is less than proj_picture_width / 2 and xProjPicture is greater than or equal \nto proj_picture_width / 2, xProjPicture is set equal to xProjPicture \u2212 proj_picture_width / 2. \n\u2013  When ProjRegionLeft[ n

Otherwise (ErpFlag is equal to 1), \nprojPicWidth is set equal to ConstituentPicWidth \u2212 ( left_gb_erp_width + right_gb_erp_width ). \n\u2013  Clause D.2.35.6.6 is invoked with xProjPicture, yProjPicture, projPicWidth, and ConstituentPicHeight as inputs, and \nthe outputs indicating the sphere coordinates and the constituent picture index (for frame-packed stereoscopic video) \nfor the sample location (x, y) within the region-wise packed picture. \nD.2.35.6.6  Conversion from a sample location in a projected picture to sphere coordinates relative to the global \ncoordinate axes \nInputs to this clause are: \n\u2013  the centre point of a sample location (xProjPicture, yProjPicture) within a projected picture, where xProjPicture and \nyProjPicture are in relative projected picture sample units and may have non-integer real values, and \n\u2013  pictureWidth and pictureHeight, which are the width and height, respectively, of a monoscopic projected luma picture, \nin relative projected picture sample units. \nOutputs of this clause are: \n\u2013  sphere coordinates (azimuthGlobal, elevationGlobal), in units of degrees relative to the global coordinate axes, and \n\u2013  when StereoFlag is equal to 1, the index of the constituent picture (constituentPicture) equal to 0 or 1. \nThe outputs are derived with the following ordered steps: \n\u2013  If xProjPicture is greater than or equal to pictureWidth or yProjPicture is greater than or equal to pictureHeight, the \nfollowing applies: \n\u2013  constituentPicture is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  If xProjPicture is greater than or equal to pictureWidth, xProjPicture is set to xProjPicture \u2212 pictureWidth. \n\u2013  If yProjPicture is greater than or equal to pictureHeight, yProjPicture is set to yProjPicture \u2212 pictureHeight. \n\u2013  Otherwise, constituentPicture is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  Clause D.2.35.6.2 is invoked with pictureWidth, pictureHeight, xProjPicture, and yProjPicture as inputs, and the \noutput is assigned to azimuthLocal, elevationLocal. \n \n\n\u2013  If RotationFlag is equal to 1, clause D.2.35.6.3 is invoked with azimuthLocal, elevationLocal, RotationYaw, \nRotationPitch, and RotationRoll as inputs, and the output is assigned to azimuthGlobal and elevationGlobal. \n\u2013  Otherwise, azimuthGlobal is set equal to azimuthLocal and elevationGlobal is set equal to elevationLocal. \nD.2.36  SEI manifest SEI message semantics \nThe SEI manifest SEI message conveys information on SEI messages that are indicated as expected (i.e., likely) to be \npresent or not present. Such information may include: \n1)  The indication that certain types of SEI messages are expected (i.e., likely) to be present (although not guaranteed \nto be present) in the CVS. \n2)  For each type of SEI message that is indicated as expected (i.e., likely) to be present in the CVS, the degree of \nexpressed necessity of interpretation of the SEI messages of this type. \nThe degree of necessity of interpretation of an SEI message type may be indicated as \"necessary\", \"unnecessary\", \nor \"undetermined\". \nAn SEI message is indicated by the encoder (i.e., the content producer) as being \"necessary\" when the information \nconveyed by the SEI message is considered as necessary for interpretation by the decoder or receiving system in \norder to properly process the content and enable an adequate user experience; it does not mean that the bitstream \nis required to contain the SEI message in order to be a conforming bitstream. It is at the discretion of the encoder \nto determine which SEI messages are to be considered as necessary in a particular CVS. However, it is suggested \nthat some SEI  messages,  such as the frame packing arrangement, segmented rectangular  frame packing \narrangement,  and  omnidirectional  projection  indication  SEI  messages,  should  typically  be  considered  as \nnecessary. \n3)  The indication that certain types of SEI messages are expected (i.e., likely) not to be present (although not \nguaranteed not to be present) in the CVS. \nNOTE \u2013 An example of such a usage of an SEI manifest SEI message is to express the expectation that there are no frame \npacking arrangement SEI messages, segmented rectangular frame packing arrangement SEI messages, display orientation \nSEI messages, or omnidirectional projection indication SEI messages in the CVS, and therefore that the rendering of the \ndecoded video pictures for display purposes would not need any of the additional post-processing that is commonly \nassociated with the interpretation of these SEI messages. \nThe content of an SEI manifest SEI message may, for example, be used by transport-layer or systems-layer processing \nelements to determine whether the CVS is suitable for delivery to a receiving and decoding system, based on whether the \nreceiving system can properly process the CVS to enable an adequate user experience or whether the CVS satisfies the \napplication needs. \nWhen an SEI manifest SEI message is present in any access unit of a CVS, an SEI manifest SEI message shall be present \nin the first access unit of the CVS. The SEI manifest SEI message persists in decoding order from the current access unit \nuntil the end of the CVS. When there are multiple SEI manifest SEI messages present in a CVS, they shall have the same \ncontent. \nAn SEI NAL unit containing an SEI manifest SEI message shall not contain any other SEI messages other than SEI prefix \nindication SEI messages. When present in an SEI NAL unit, the SEI manifest SEI message shall be the first SEI message \nin the SEI NAL unit. \nmanifest_num_sei_msg_types specifies the number of types of SEI messages for which information is provided in the \nSEI manifest SEI message. \nmanifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] indicates the payloadType value of the i-th type of SEI message for which information is \nprovided  in  the  SEI  manifest  SEI  message.  The  values  of  manifest_sei_payload_type[ m ]  and \nmanifest_sei_payload_type[ n ] shall not be identical when m is not equal to n. \nmanifest_sei_description[ i ]  provides  information  on  SEI  messages  with  payloadType  equal  to \nmanifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] as specified in Table D-12. \n \n\nTable D-12\u2013 manifest_sei_description[ i ] values \n \nValue  Description \nIndicates that there is no SEI message with payloadType equal to \n0 \nmanifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] expected to be present in the CVS. \nIndicates  that  there  are  SEI  messages  with  payloadType  equal  to \n1  manifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] expected to be present in the CVS, and  \nthese SEI messages are considered as necessary. \nIndicates  that  there  are  SEI  messages  with  payloadType  equal  to \n2  manifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] expected to be present in the CVS, and  \nthese SEI messages are considered as unnecessary. \nIndicates  that  there  are  SEI  messages  with  payloadType  equal  to \n3  manifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] expected to be present in the CVS, and  \nthe necessity of these SEI messages is undetermined. \n4-255  Reserved \n \nThe value of manifest_sei_description[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 3, inclusive, in bitstreams conforming to this version \nof this Specification. Other values for manifest_sei_description[ i ] are reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. \nDecoders shall allow the value of manifest_sei_description[ i ] greater than or equal to 4 to appear in the syntax and shall \nignore all information for payloadType equal to manifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] signalled in the SEI manifest SEI message \nand  shall  ignore  all  SEI  prefix  indication  SEI  messages  with  prefix_sei_payload_type  equal  to \nmanifest_sei_payload_type[ i ] when manifest_sei_description[ i ] is greater than or equal to 4. \nD.2.37  SEI prefix indication SEI message semantics \nThe SEI prefix indication SEI message carries one or more SEI prefix indications for SEI messages of a particular value \nof payloadType. Each SEI prefix indication is a bit string that follows the SEI payload syntax of that value of payloadType \nand contains a number of complete syntax elements starting from the first syntax element in the SEI payload. \nEach SEI prefix indication for an SEI message of a particular value of payloadType indicates that one or more SEI messages \nof this value of payloadType are expected (i.e., likely) to be present in the CVS and to start with the provided bit string. A \nstarting bit string would typically contain only a true subset of an SEI payload of the type of SEI message indicated by the \npayloadType, may contain a complete SEI payload, and shall not contain more than a complete SEI payload. It is not \nprohibited for SEI messages of the indicated value of payloadType to be present that do not start with any of the indicated \nbit strings. \nThese SEI prefix indications should provide sufficient information for indicating what type of processing is needed or what \ntype of content is included. The former (type of processing) indicates decoder-side processing capability, e.g., whether \nsome type of frame unpacking is needed. The latter (type of content) indicates, for example, whether the bitstream contains \nsubtitle captions in a particular language. \nThe content of an SEI prefix indication SEI message may, for example, be used by transport-layer or systems-layer \nprocessing elements to determine whether the CVS is suitable for delivery to a receiving and decoding system, based on \nwhether the receiving system can properly process the CVS to enable an adequate user experience or whether the CVS \nsatisfies the application needs (as determined in some manner by external means outside the scope of this Specification). \nIn one example, when the payloadType indicates the frame packing arrangement SEI message, an SEI prefix indication \nshould include up to at least the syntax element frame_packing_arrangement_type; and when the payloadType indicates \nthe omnidirectional projection indication SEI message, an SEI prefix indication should include up to at least the syntax \nelement projection_type. \nIn another example, for user data registered SEI messages that are used to carry captioning information, an SEI prefix \nindication should include up to at least the language code; and for user data unregistered SEI messages extended for private \nuse, an SEI prefix indication should include up to at least the UUID. \nWhen an SEI prefix indication SEI message is present in any access unit of a CVS, an SEI prefix indication SEI message \nshall be present in the first access unit of the CVS. The SEI prefix indication SEI message persists in decoding order from \nthe current access unit until the end of the CVS. When there are multiple SEI prefix indication SEI messages present in a \nCVS for a particular value of payloadType, they shall have the same content. \n \n\nAn SEI NAL unit containing an SEI prefix indication SEI message for a particular value of payloadType shall not contain \nany other SEI messages other than an SEI manifest SEI message and SEI prefix indication SEI messages for other values \nof payloadType. \nprefix_sei_payload_type indicates the payloadType value of the SEI messages for which one or more SEI prefix \nindications are provided in the SEI prefix indication SEI message. When an SEI manifest SEI message is also present for \nthe CVS, the value of prefix_sei_payload_type shall be equal to one of the manifest_sei_payload_type[ m ] values for \nwhich manifest_sei_description[ m ] is equal to 1 to 3, inclusive, as indicated by an SEI manifest SEI message that applies \nto the CVS. \nnum_sei_prefix_indications_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of SEI prefix indications. \nnum_bits_in_prefix_indication_minus1[ i ] plus 1 specifies the number of bits in the i-th SEI prefix indication. \nsei_prefix_data_bit[ i ][ j ] specifies the j-th bit of the i-th SEI prefix indication. \nThe bits sei_prefix_data_bit[ i ][ j ] for j ranging from 0 to num_bits_in_prefix_indication_minus1[ i ], inclusive, follow \nthe syntax of the SEI payload with payloadType equal to prefix_sei_payload_type, and contain a number of complete \nsyntax elements starting from the first syntax element in the SEI payload syntax, and may or may not contain all the syntax \nelements  in  the  SEI  payload  syntax.  The  last  bit  of  these  bits  (i.e.,  the  bit \nsei_prefix_data_bit[ i ][ num_bits_in_prefix_indication_minus1[ i ] ]) shall be the last bit of a syntax element in the SEI \npayload syntax, unless it is a bit within an itu_t_t35_payload_byte or user_data_payload_byte. \nNOTE \u2013 The exception for itu_t_t35_payload_byte and user_data_payload_byte is provided because these syntax elements may \ncontain externally-specified syntax elements, and the determination of the boundaries of such externally-specified syntax elements \nis a matter outside the scope of this Specification. \nD.2.38  Reserved SEI message semantics \nThis message consists of data reserved for future backward-compatible use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Encoders conforming to \nthis Recommendation | International Standard shall not send reserved SEI messages until and unless the use of such \nmessages has been specified by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. Decoders that encounter reserved SEI messages shall discard their \ncontent without effect on the decoding process, except as specified in future Recommendations | International Standards \nspecified by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. \nreserved_sei_message_payload_byte is a byte reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. \n \n\nAnnex E \n \nVideo usability information \n \n(This annex forms an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard.) \nThis annex specifies syntax and semantics of the VUI parameters of the sequence parameter sets. \nVUI parameters are not required for constructing the luma or chroma samples by the decoding process. Conforming \ndecoders  are  not  required  to  process  this  information  for  output  order  conformance  to  this \nRecommendation | International Standard (see Annex C for the specification of conformance). Some VUI parameters are \nrequired to check bitstream conformance and for output timing decoder conformance. \nIn Annex E, specification for presence of VUI parameters is also satisfied when those parameters (or some subset of them) \nare conveyed to decoders (or to the HRD) by other means not specified by this Recommendation | International Standard. \nWhen present in the bitstream, VUI parameters shall follow the syntax and semantics specified in clauses 7.3.2.1 and \n7.4.2.1 and this annex. When the content of VUI parameters is conveyed for the application by some means other than \npresence within the bitstream, the representation of the content of the VUI parameters is not required to use the same syntax \nspecified in this annex. For the purpose of counting bits, only the appropriate bits that are actually present in the bitstream \nare counted. \nE.1  VUI syntax \nE.1.1  VUI parameters syntax \n \nvui_parameters( ) {  C  Descriptor \n  aspect_ratio_info_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( aspect_ratio_info_present_flag ) {     \n    aspect_ratio_idc  0  u(8) \n    if( aspect_ratio_idc  = =  Extended_SAR ) {     \n      sar_width  0  u(16) \n      sar_height  0  u(16) \n    }     \n  }     \n  overscan_info_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( overscan_info_present_flag )     \n    overscan_appropriate_flag  0  u(1) \n  video_signal_type_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( video_signal_type_present_flag ) {     \n    video_format  0  u(3) \n    video_full_range_flag  0  u(1) \n    colour_description_present_flag  0  u(1) \n    if( colour_description_present_flag ) {     \n      colour_primaries  0  u(8) \n      transfer_characteristics  0  u(8) \n      matrix_coefficients  0  u(8) \n    }     \n  }     \n  chroma_loc_info_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( chroma_loc_info_present_flag ) {     \n    chroma_sample_loc_type_top_field  0  ue(v) \n    chroma_sample_loc_type_bottom_field  0  ue(v) \n  }     \n \n\n  timing_info_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( timing_info_present_flag ) {     \n    num_units_in_tick  0  u(32) \n    time_scale  0  u(32) \n    fixed_frame_rate_flag  0  u(1) \n  }     \n  nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag )     \n    hrd_parameters( )  0   \n  vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag )     \n    hrd_parameters( )  0   \n  if( nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag  | |  vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag )     \n    low_delay_hrd_flag  0  u(1) \n  pic_struct_present_flag   0  u(1) \n  bitstream_restriction_flag  0  u(1) \n  if( bitstream_restriction_flag ) {     \n    motion_vectors_over_pic_boundaries_flag  0  u(1) \n    max_bytes_per_pic_denom  0  ue(v) \n    max_bits_per_mb_denom  0  ue(v) \n    log2_max_mv_length_horizontal  0  ue(v) \n    log2_max_mv_length_vertical  0  ue(v) \n    max_num_reorder_frames  0  ue(v) \n    max_dec_frame_buffering  0  ue(v) \n  }     \n}     \n \nE.1.2  HRD parameters syntax \n \nhrd_parameters( ) {  C  Descriptor \n  cpb_cnt_minus1  0 | 5  ue(v) \n  bit_rate_scale  0 | 5  u(4) \n  cpb_size_scale  0 | 5  u(4) \n  for( SchedSelIdx = 0; SchedSelIdx <= cpb_cnt_minus1; SchedSelIdx++ ) {     \n    bit_rate_value_minus1[ SchedSelIdx ]  0 | 5  ue(v) \n    cpb_size_value_minus1[ SchedSelIdx ]  0 | 5  ue(v) \n    cbr_flag[ SchedSelIdx ]  0 | 5  u(1) \n  }     \n  initial_cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1  0 | 5  u(5) \n  cpb_removal_delay_length_minus1  0 | 5  u(5) \n  dpb_output_delay_length_minus1  0 | 5  u(5) \n  time_offset_length  0 | 5  u(5) \n}     \n \n \n\nE.2  VUI semantics \nE.2.1  VUI parameters semantics \naspect_ratio_info_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that aspect_ratio_idc is present. aspect_ratio_info_present_flag equal \nto 0 specifies that aspect_ratio_idc is not present. \naspect_ratio_idc specifies the value of the sample aspect ratio of the luma samples.

As an example, the \nentry \"720x576 4:3 frame with horizontal overscan\" for aspect_ratio_idc equal to 2 refers to having an area of 704x576 luma samples \n(which has an aspect ratio of 4:3) of the cropped decoded frame (720x576 luma samples) that is visible in the display area. \nsar_width indicates the horizontal size of the sample aspect ratio (in arbitrary units). \nsar_height indicates the vertical size of the sample aspect ratio (in the same arbitrary units as sar_width). \nsar_width and sar_height shall be relatively prime or equal to 0. When aspect_ratio_idc is equal to 0 or sar_width is equal \nto 0 or sar_height is equal to 0, the sample aspect ratio shall be considered unspecified by this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard. \noverscan_info_present_flag  equal  to 1  specifies  that  the  overscan_appropriate_flag  is  present.  When \noverscan_info_present_flag is equal to 0 or is not present, the preferred display method for the video signal is unspecified. \n \n\noverscan_appropriate_flag equal to 1 indicates that the cropped decoded pictures output are suitable for display using \noverscan. overscan_appropriate_flag equal to 0 indicates that the cropped decoded pictures output contain visually \nimportant information in the entire region out to the edges of the cropping rectangle of the picture, such that the cropped \ndecoded pictures output should not be displayed using overscan. Instead, they should be displayed using either an exact \nmatch between the display area and the cropping rectangle, or using underscan. As used in this paragraph, the term \n\"overscan\" refers to display processes in which some parts near the borders of the cropped decoded pictures are not visible \nin the display area.

currDQId be the current value of DQId and let levelIdc be the value of level_idc in the SVC sequence parameter set \nthat is referred to in coded slice NAL units with DQId equal to (( currDQId >> 4 )

When frame_mbs_only_flag is equal to 0 and RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 1, the variable scaledH is \nmodified by \nscaledH = scaledH / 2  (G-34) \n3.  The variables refPhaseX, refPhaseY, phaseX, phaseY, subW, and subH are derived by \nrefPhaseX = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  0  :  ( ref_layer_chroma_phase_x_plus1_flag \u2212 1 ) )  (G-35) \nrefPhaseY = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  0  :  ( ref_layer_chroma_phase_y_plus1 \u2212 1 ) )  (G-36) \nphaseX      = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  0  :  ( chroma_phase_x_plus1_flag \u2212 1 ) )  (G-37) \nphaseY      = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  0  :  ( chroma_phase_y_plus1 \u2212 1 ) )  (G-38) \nsubW         = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  1  :  SubWidthC )  (G-39) \nsubH          = ( ( chromaFlag  = =  0 )  ?  1  :  SubHeightC )  (G-40) \n4.  When RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 0 or frame_mbs_only_flag is equal to 0, the following applies: \n\u2013  If RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 1, the variables phaseY and refPhaseY are modified by \nphaseY      = phaseY + 4 * botFieldFlag + 3 \u2212 subH  (G-41) \nrefPhaseY = 2 * refPhaseY + 2  (G-42) \n\u2013  Otherwise (RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 0), the variables phaseY and refPhaseY are modified \nby \nphaseY      = phaseY + 4 * botFieldFlag  (G-43) \nrefPhaseY = refPhaseY + 4 * botFieldFlag  (G-44) \n5.  The variables shiftX and shiftY are derived by \nshiftX = ( ( levelIdc <= 30 )  ?  16  :  ( 31 \u2212 Ceil( Log2( refW ) ) ) )  (G-45) \nshiftY = ( ( levelIdc <= 30 )  ?  16  :  ( 31 \u2212 Ceil( Log2( refH  ) ) ) )  (G-46) \n6.

The variables offsetX, addX, and deltaX are derived by \noffsetX = ScaledRefLayerLeftOffset / subW  (G-49) \naddX    = ( ( ( refW * ( 2 + phaseX ) ) << ( shiftX \u2212 2 ) ) + ( scaledW >> 1 ) ) / scaledW \n                + ( 1 << ( shiftX \u2212 5 ) )  (G-50) \ndeltaX  = 4 * ( 2 + refPhaseX )  (G-51) \n8.  The variables offsetY, addY, and deltaY are derived as follows: \n\u2013  If RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 1 and frame_mbs_only_flag is equal to 1, the variables offsetY, \naddY, and deltaY are derived by \noffsetY = ScaledRefLayerTopOffset / subH  (G-52) \naddY    = ( ( ( refH * ( 2 + phaseY ) ) << ( shiftY \u2212 2 ) ) + ( scaledH >> 1 ) ) / scaledH \n                + ( 1 << ( shiftY \u2212 5 ) )  (G-53) \ndeltaY  = 4 * ( 2 + refPhaseY )  (G-54) \n\u2013  Otherwise (RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 0 or frame_mbs_only_flag is equal to 0), the variables \noffsetY, addY, and deltaY are derived by \noffsetY = ScaledRefLayerTopOffset / ( 2 * subH )  (G-55) \naddY    = ( ( ( refH * ( 2 + phaseY ) ) << ( shiftY \u2212 3 ) ) + ( scaledH >> 1 ) ) / scaledH \n                + ( 1 << ( shiftY \u2212 5 ) )  (G-56) \ndeltaY  = 2 * ( 2 + refPhaseY )  (G-57) \nNOTE \u2013 The variables subW, subH, shiftX, shiftY, scaleX, scaleY, offsetX, offsetY, addX, addY, deltaX, and deltaY do not depend \non the input sample location ( xP, yP ), the input variable fieldMbFlag, or the current macroblock address CurrMbAddr. \nThe sample location ( xC, yC ) is derived as specified in the following ordered steps: \n \n\n1.  The inverse macroblock scanning process as specified in clause 6.4.1 is invoked with CurrMbAddr as input and \nthe output is assigned to ( xM, yM ). For this invocation of the process in clause 6.4.1, the current macroblock is \ntreated as field macroblock when fieldMbFlag is equal to 1 and it is treated as frame macroblock when \nfieldMbFlag is equal to 0. \n2.  The sample location ( xC, yC ) is derived by \nxC = xP + ( xM >> ( subW \u2212 1 ) )  (G-58) \nyC = yP + ( yM >> ( subH  \u2212 1 + fieldMbFlag \u2212 field_pic_flag ) )  (G-59) \n3.  When RefLayerFrameMbsOnlyFlag is equal to 0 or frame_mbs_only_flag is equal to 0, the vertical component \nof the sample location ( xC, yC ) is modified by \nyC = yC >> ( 1 \u2212 fieldMbFlag )  (G-60) \nThe reference layer sample location ( xRef16 yRef16 ) is derived by \nxRef16 = ( ( ( xC \u2212 offsetX ) * scaleX + addX ) >> ( shiftX \u2212 4 ) ) \u2212 deltaX  (G-61) \nyRef16 = ( ( ( yC

\n\u2013  a variable currDQId specifying an identifier for a layer representation, \n\u2013  a luma location ( xP, yP ) relative to the upper-left luma sample of a macroblock, \n\u2013  a macroblock type mbType, \n\u2013  when mbType is equal to P_8x8, P_8x8ref0, or B_8x8, a list of sub-macroblock types subMbType with 4 elements. \nOutputs of this process are: \n\u2013  a macroblock partition index mbPartIdx, \n\u2013  a sub-macroblock partition index subMbPartIdx. \nThe variable svcDirectModeFlag is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If currDQId is greater than 0 and any of the following conditions are true, svcDirectModeFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  mbType is equal to B_Skip or B_Direct_16x16 \n\u2013  mbType is equal to B_8x8 and subMbType[ 2 * ( yP / 8 ) + ( xP / 8 ) ] is equal to B_Direct_8x8 \n\u2013  Otherwise, svcDirectModeFlag is set equal to 0. \nDepending on svcDirectModeFlag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If svcDirectModeFlag is equal to 0, the derivation process for macroblock and sub-macroblock partition indices as \nspecified in clause 6.4.13.4 is invoked with the luma location ( xP, yP ), the macroblock type mbType, and, when \nmbType is equal to P_8x8, P_8x8ref0, or B_8x8, the list of sub-macroblock types subMbType as the inputs and the \noutputs are the macroblock partition index mbPartIdx and the sub-macroblock partition index subMbPartIdx. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if mbType is equal to B_Skip or B_Direct_16x16, mbPartIdx is set equal to 0 and subMbPartIdx is set \nequal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (currDQId is greater than 0, mbType is equal to B_8x8, and subMbType[ 2 * ( yP / 8 ) + ( xP / 8 ) ] is \nequal to B_Direct_8x8), mbPartIdx is set equal to ( 2 * ( yP / 8 ) + ( xP / 8 ) ) and subMbPartIdx is set equal to 0. \nG.7  Syntax and

structures (in clause G.7.3 and in \nclause 7.3 by reference in clause G.7.3) are specified in this clause and by reference to clause 7.4. When the semantics of \na syntax element are specified using a table or a set of tables, any values that are not specified in the table(s) shall not be \npresent in the bitstream unless otherwise specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \nSub-bitstreams that are derived according to the process specified in clause G.8.8.1 shall conform to one or more of the \nprofiles specified in Annex A or one or more of the profiles specified in this annex. \n \n\nOne or more sub-bitstreams shall conform to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A. The decoding for these sub-\nbitstreams is specified in clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes B to E. \nThe decoding for bitstreams conforming to one or more of the profiles specified in this annex is completely specified in \nthis annex with reference made to clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes B to E. \nA specification or a process in clauses 2 to 9 and Annexes B to E may be used as is or by specifying assignments or \nalternative meanings of certain parts. \nThis clause describes the semantics of syntax elements. The syntax elements appear multiple times in the bitstream and in \neach access unit. The meaning of each syntax element and derived variables depends on the position of the syntax structure \nin the bitstream in which it is contained. A decoder conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard processes \nthe syntax structures in decoding order and determines the semantics according to the position derived from that. \nG.7.4.1 NAL unit semantics \nThe semantics for the syntax elements in clause G.7.3.1 are specified in clause 7.4.1. The following specifications \nadditionally apply. \nFor NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 14, nal_ref_idc shall be identical to nal_ref_idc of the associated NAL unit, \nwhich succeeds the NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 14 in decoding order. \nThe value of nal_ref_idc shall be the same for all VCL NAL units of a dependency representation. \nThe variable refNalRefIdc is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If nal_unit_type is not equal to 20 or dependency_id is equal to the minimum value of dependency_id for all VCL \nNAL units of the coded picture, refNalRefIdc is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (nal_unit_type is equal to 20 and dependency_id is not equal to the minimum value of dependency_id for \nall VCL NAL units of the coded picture), refNalRefIdc is set equal to the maximum value of nal_ref_idc for all VCL \nNAL units of the coded picture with a value of dependency_id less than the current value of dependency_id. \nWhen refNalRefIdc is greater than 0, the value of nal_ref_idc shall not be equal to 0. \nnal_ref_idc equal to 0 for a NAL unit containing a slice and having a value of dependency_id that is equal to the maximum \nvalue of dependency_id in the coded picture indicates that all coded slice NAL units of the coded picture are coded slice \nNAL units of a non-reference picture. \nnal_ref_idc greater than 0 for a NAL unit containing a slice and having a value of dependency_id that is equal to the \nmaximum value of dependency_id in the coded picture indicates that all coded slice NAL units of the coded picture are \ncoded slice NAL units of a reference picture. \nG.7.4.1.1  NAL unit header SVC extension semantics \nThe  syntax  elements  idr_flag,  priority_id,  no_inter_layer_pred_flag,  dependency_id,  quality_id,  temporal_id, \nuse_ref_base_pic_flag, discardable_flag, and output_flag, when present in a prefix NAL unit, are considered as if they \nwere present in the associated NAL unit. \nidr_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current coded picture is an IDR picture when the value of dependency_id for the NAL \nunit is equal to the maximum value of dependency_id in the coded picture. idr_flag equal to 0 specifies that the current \ncoded picture is not an IDR picture when the value of dependency_id for the NAL unit is equal to the maximum value of \ndependency_id in the coded picture. The value of idr_flag shall be the same for all NAL units of a dependency \nrepresentation. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The classification of a coded picture as IDR picture and the partitioning of a sequence of access units in coded video \nsequences depends on the maximum value of dependency_id that is present in the associated NAL units. When NAL units are \nremoved from a bitstream, e.g. in order to adjust the bitstream to the capabilities of a receiving device, the maximum value of \ndependency_id in the coded pictures may change and hence the classification of coded pictures as IDR pictures may change and \nwith that the partitioning of the sequence of access units into coded video sequences may change. \nWhen idr_flag is equal to 1 for a prefix NAL unit, the associated NAL unit shall have nal_unit_type equal to 5. When \nidr_flag is equal to 0 for a prefix NAL unit, the associated NAL unit shall have nal_unit_type equal to 1. \nWhen nal_ref_idc is equal to 0, the value of idr_flag shall be equal to 0. \nFor NAL units, in which idr_flag is present, the variable IdrPicFlag derived in clause 7.4.1 is modified by setting it equal \nto idr_flag. \npriority_id specifies a priority identifier for the NAL unit. The assignment of values to priority_id is constrained by the \nsub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause G.8.8.1. \n \n\nNOTE 2  \u2013  The  syntax  element  priority_id  is  not  required  by  the  decoding  process  specified  in  this \nRecommendation | International Standard. The syntax element priority_id may be used as determined by the application within the \nspecified constraints. \nno_inter_layer_pred_flag specifies whether inter-layer prediction may be used for decoding the coded slice. When \nno_inter_layer_pred_flag  is  equal  to 1,  inter-layer  prediction  is  not  used  for  decoding  the  coded  slice.  When \nno_inter_layer_pred_flag is equal to 0, inter-layer prediction may be used for decoding the coded slice as signalled in the \nmacroblock layer. \nFor prefix NAL units, no_inter_layer_pred_flag shall be equal to 1. When nal_unit_type is equal to 20 and quality_id is \ngreater than 0, no_inter_layer_pred_flag shall be equal to 0. \nThe variable MinNoInterLayerPredFlag is set equal to the minimum value of no_inter_layer_pred_flag for the slices of the \nlayer representation. \ndependency_id specifies a dependency identifier for the NAL unit. dependency_id shall be equal to 0 in prefix NAL units. \nThe assignment of values to dependency_id is constrained by the sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in \nclause G.8.8.1. \nquality_id specifies a quality identifier for the NAL unit. quality_id shall be equal to 0 in prefix NAL units. The assignment \nof values to quality_id is constrained by the sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause G.8.8.1. \nThe variable DQId is derived by \nDQId = ( dependency_id << 4 ) + quality_id  (G-63) \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 20, the bitstream shall not contain data that result in DQId equal to 0. \ntemporal_id specifies a temporal identifier for the NAL unit. The assignment of values to temporal_id is constrained by \nthe sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause G.8.8.1. \nThe value of temporal_id shall be the same for all prefix NAL units and coded slice in scalable extension NAL units of an \naccess unit. When an access unit contains any NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 5 or idr_flag equal to 1, temporal_id \nshall be equal to 0. \nuse_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that reference base pictures (when present) and decoded pictures (when \nreference base pictures are not present) are used as reference pictures for inter prediction as specified in clause G.8.2.3. \nuse_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 0 specifies that reference base pictures are not used as reference pictures for inter prediction \n(i.e., only decoded pictures are used for inter prediction). \nThe values of use_ref_base_pic_flag shall be the same for all NAL units of a dependency representation. \ndiscardable_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current NAL unit is not used for decoding dependency representations that \nare part of the current coded picture or any subsequent coded picture in decoding order and have a greater value of \ndependency_id than the current NAL unit. discardable_flag equal to 0 specifies that the current NAL unit may be used for \ndecoding dependency representations that are part of the current coded picture or any subsequent coded picture in decoding \norder and have a greater value of dependency_id than the current NAL unit. \noutput_flag affects the decoded picture output and removal processes as specified in Annex C. The value of output_flag \nshall be the same for all NAL units of a dependency representation. For any particular value of dependency_id, the value \nof output_flag shall be the same for both fields of a complementary field pair. \nreserved_three_2bits shall be equal to 3. Other values of reserved_three_2bits may be specified in the future by ITU-T | \nISO/IEC. Decoders shall ignore the value of reserved_three_2bits. \nG.7.4.1.2  Order of NAL units and association to coded pictures, access units, and video sequences \nThis clause specifies constraints on the order of NAL units in the bitstream. Any order of NAL units in the bitstream \nobeying these constraints is referred to in the text as the decoding order of NAL units. Within a NAL unit, the syntax in \nclauses 7.3, D.1, E.1, G.7.3, G.13.1, and G.14.1 specifies the decoding order of syntax elements. Decoders shall be capable \nof receiving NAL units and their syntax elements in decoding order. \nG.7.4.1.2.1  Order of SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs and picture parameter set RBSPs and their activation \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The sequence and picture parameter set mechanism decouples the transmission of infrequently changing information \nfrom the transmission of coded macroblock data. Sequence and picture parameter sets may, in some applications, be conveyed \"out-\nof-band\" using a reliable transport mechanism. \nA picture parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by the coded slice NAL units of one or more \nlayer representations of one or more coded pictures. \nEach picture parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding process. At \nmost one picture parameter set RBSP is considered as the active picture parameter set RBSP at any given moment during \n \n\nthe operation of the decoding process, and when any particular picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture \nparameter set RBSP, the previously-active picture parameter set RBSP (if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active picture parameter set RBSP, zero or more picture parameter set RBSPs may be specifically active \nfor layer representations (with a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax) that may be referred to through inter-layer \nprediction in decoding the target layer representation. Such a picture parameter set RBSP is referred to as active layer \npicture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId (less than DQIdMax). The restrictions on active picture \nparameter set RBSPs also apply to active layer picture parameter set RBSPs with a particular value of DQId. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active picture parameter \nset RBSP and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit with DQId equal to DQIdMax (using that value of \npic_parameter_set_id), it is activated. This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active picture parameter set RBSP \nuntil it is deactivated when another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP. A picture \nparameter set RBSP, with that particular value of pic_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to \nits activation. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active layer picture \nparameter set for a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit with the \nparticular value of DQId (using that value of pic_parameter_set_id), it is activated for layer representations with the \nparticular value of DQId. This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active layer picture parameter set RBSP for the \nparticular value of DQId until it is deactivated when another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active layer picture \nparameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId or when decoding an access unit with DQIdMax less than or equal to \nthe particular value of DQId. A picture parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of pic_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nAny picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active picture parameter set \nRBSP for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active picture parameter set RBSP for the coded picture \nunless it follows the last VCL NAL unit of the coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture. \nAny picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active layer picture parameter \nset RBSP for a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the \nactive layer picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId for the coded picture unless it follows the last \nVCL NAL unit of the coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture. \nWhen a picture parameter set NAL unit with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces \nthe content of the previous picture parameter set NAL unit, in decoding order, with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id \n(when a previous picture parameter set NAL unit with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id was present in the \nbitstream). \nNOTE 2 \u2013 A decoder must be capable of simultaneously storing the contents of the picture parameter sets for all values of \npic_parameter_set_id. The content of the picture parameter set with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id is overwritten when \na new picture parameter set NAL unit with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id is received. \nAn SVC sequence parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by one or more picture parameter set \nRBSPs or one or more SEI NAL units containing a buffering period SEI message. \nEach SVC sequence parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding \nprocess. At most one SVC sequence parameter set RBSP is considered as the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP at \nany given moment during the operation of the decoding process, and when any particular SVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP becomes the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP, the previously-active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP \n(if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP, zero or more SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs may be \nspecifically active for layer representations (with a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax) that may be referred to \nthrough inter-layer prediction in decoding the target layer representation. Such an SVC sequence parameter set RBSP is \nreferred to as active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId (less than DQIdMax). The \nrestrictions on active SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs also apply to active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs \nwith a particular value of DQId. \nFor the following specification in this clause, the activating buffering period SEI message is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the access unit contains one or more buffering period SEI messages that are included in a scalable nesting SEI \nmessage  and  are  associated  with  values  of  DQId  in  the  range  of  ( ( DQIdMax >> 4) << 4)  to \n( ( ( DQIdMax >> 4 ) << 4 ) + 15), inclusive, the last of these buffering period SEI messages in decoding order is the \nactivating buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if DQIdMax is equal to 0 and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message that is not included \nin a scalable nesting SEI message, this buffering period SEI message is the activating buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message. \n \n\nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with \nnal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP and \nDQIdMax is equal to 0) and the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message, the sequence \nparameter set RBSP is activated. This sequence parameter set RBSP, is called the active SVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the \ndecoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI message \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in a scalable nesting SEI message (DQIdMax is equal to 0), \nthe sequence parameter set RBSP is activated. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active SVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active SVC \nsequence parameter set RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall \nbe available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set \nRBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice in \nscalable extension NAL unit (nal_unit_type is equal to 20) with DQId equal to DQIdMax (the picture parameter set RBSP \nbecomes the active picture parameter set RBSP) and the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage, the subset sequence parameter set RBSP is activated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the \nactive SVC sequence parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes \nthe active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of \nseq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is included in a scalable nesting SEI message, the subset sequence \nparameter set RBSP is activated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP, is called the active SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active SVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 The active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP is either a sequence parameter set RBSP or a subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP. Sequence parameter set RBSPs are activated by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 or buffering \nperiod SEI messages that are not included in a scalable nesting SEI message. Subset sequence parameter set RBSPs are activated by \ncoded slice in scalable extension NAL units (nal_unit_type equal to 20) or buffering period SEI messages that are included in a \nscalable nesting SEI message. A sequence parameter set RBSP and a subset sequence parameter set RBSP may have the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 Buffering period SEI messages have a higher priority for activating SVC sequence parameter sets than coded slice NAL \nunits. When an SVC sequence parameter set RBSP is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP inside a particular \naccess unit and this picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with DQId equal to DQIdMax (the picture \nparameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP) and this particular access unit also contains an activating \nbuffering period SEI message that refers to an SVC sequence parameter set RBSP that is different than the SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP referred to by the activation of the picture parameter set RBSP, the SVC sequence parameter set RBSP that is referred to \nby the activating buffering period SEI message becomes the active SVC sequence parameter set. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 Compared to the specifications for profiles specified in Annex A, where an activated sequence parameter set RBSP must \nremain active for the entire coded video sequence, the specification for profiles specified in this annex differs. When an SVC \nsequence parameter set RBSP is already active (as the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP), another SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP becomes the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP in a non-IDR access unit when it is referred to by an activating \nbuffering period SEI message or by the activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (as the active picture parameter set RBSP). In \nthis case, the contents of the de-activated and activated SVC sequence parameter set RBSP are mutually restricted as described \nbelow. Hence, within a coded video sequence, multiple successively activated/de-activated SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs can \nbe present. \nFor the following specification in this clause, the activating layer buffering period SEI message for a particular value of \nDQId is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If the access unit contains a buffering period SEI messages that is included in a scalable nesting SEI message and is \nassociated with the particular value of DQId, this buffering period SEI message is the activating layer buffering period \nSEI message for the particular value of DQId. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the particular value of DQId is equal to 0 and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message \nthat is not included in a scalable nesting SEI message, this buffering period SEI message is the activating layer \nbuffering period SEI message for the particular value of DQId. \n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating layer buffering period SEI message for the particular value \nof DQId. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for DQId equal to 0 and it is referred to by activation of a \npicture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by \na coded slice NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 and DQIdMax is greater than 0 (the picture parameter set RBSP \nbecomes the active layer picture parameter set RBSP for DQId equal to 0) and the access unit does not contain an activating \nlayer buffering period SEI message for DQId equal to 0, the sequence parameter set RBSP is activated for layer \nrepresentations with DQId equal to 0. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active layer SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP for DQId equal to 0 until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active \nlayer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for DQId equal to 0 or when decoding an access unit with DQIdMax equal to 0. \nA sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for DQId equal to 0 and it is referred to by an activating layer \nbuffering period SEI message for DQId equal to 0 (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in a \nscalable nesting SEI message and DQIdMax is greater than 0, the sequence parameter set RBSP is activated for layer \nrepresentations with DQId equal to 0. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active layer SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP for DQId equal to 0 until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active \nlayer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for DQId equal to 0 or when decoding an access unit with DQIdMax equal to 0. \nA sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax and \nit is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture \nparameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice in scalable extension NAL unit (nal_unit_type is equal to 20) with the \nparticular value of DQId (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active layer picture parameter set RBSP for the \nparticular value of DQId) and the access unit does not contain an activating layer buffering period SEI message for the \nparticular value of DQId, the subset sequence parameter set is activated for layer representations with the particular value \nof DQId. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the \nparticular value of DQId until it is deactivated when another SVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active layer \nSVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId or when decoding an access unit with DQIdMax less \nthan or equal to the particular value of DQId. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of \nseq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax and \nit is referred to by an activating layer buffering period SEI message for the particular value of DQId (using that value of \nseq_parameter_set_id) that is included in a scalable nesting SEI message, the subset sequence parameter set RBSP is \nactivated for layer representations with the particular value of DQId. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called \nthe active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of DQId until it is deactivated when another \nSVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value \nof DQId or when decoding an access unit with DQIdMax less than or equal to the particular value of DQId. A subset \nsequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nA sequence parameter set RBSP or a subset sequence parameter set RBSP that includes a value of profile_idc not specified \nin Annex A or G shall not be referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP as the active picture parameter set \nRBSP or as active layer picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) or referred to by a buffering \nperiod SEI message (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id). A sequence parameter set RBSP or a subset sequence \nparameter set RBSP including a value of profile_idc not specified in Annex A or G is ignored in the decoding for profiles \nspecified in Annex A or G. \nLet spsA and spsB be two SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs with one of the following properties: \n\u2013  spsA is the SVC sequence parameter set RBSP that is referred to by the coded slice NAL units (via the picture \nparameter set) of a layer representation with a particular value of dependency_id and quality_id equal to 0 and spsB \nis the SVC sequence parameter set RBSP that is referred to by the coded slice NAL units (via the picture parameter \nset) of another layer representation, in the same access unit, with the same value of dependency_id and quality_id \ngreater than 0, \n \n\n\u2013  spsA is the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for an access unit and spsB is the SVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP that is referred to by the coded slice NAL units (via the picture parameter set) of the layer representation with \nDQId equal to DQIdMax, \n\u2013  spsA is the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for an IDR access unit and spsB is the active SVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP for any non-IDR access unit of the same coded video sequence. \nThe SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs spsA and spsB are restricted with regards to their contents as specified in the \nfollowing. \n\u2013  The values of the syntax elements in the seq_parameter_set_data( ) syntax structure of spsA and spsB may only differ \nfor the following syntax elements and shall be the same otherwise: profile_idc, constraint_setX_flag (with X being \nequal  to  0  to  5,  inclusive),  reserved_zero_2bits,  level_idc,  seq_parameter_set_id,  timing_info_present_flag, \nnum_units_in_tick,  time_scale,  fixed_frame_rate_flag,  nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag, \nvcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag, low_delay_hrd_flag, pic_struct_present_flag, and the hrd_parameters( ) syntax \nstructures. \n\u2013  When spsA is the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and spsB is the SVC sequence parameter set RBSP that \nis referred to by the coded slice NAL units of the layer representation with DQId equal to DQIdMax, the level \nspecified by level_idc (or level_idc and constraint_set3_flag) in spsA shall not be less than the level specified by \nlevel_idc (or level_idc and constraint_set3_flag) in spsB. \n\u2013  When the seq_parameter_set_svc_extension( ) syntax structure is present in both spsA and spsB, the values of all \nsyntax elements in the seq_parameter_set_svc_extension( ) syntax structure shall be the same. \nIt is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the following constraints are obeyed: \n\u2013  For each particular value of DQId, all coded slice NAL units of a coded video sequence shall refer to the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id (via the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by the value of pic_parameter_set_id). \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is not included in a scalable nesting SEI \nmessage shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id in the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to \nby coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (via the value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same access \nunit. \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is included in a scalable nesting SEI \nmessage and is associated with a particular value of DQId shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id in \nthe picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by coded slice NAL units with the particular value of DQId (via the \nvalue of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same access unit. \nThe active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSPs for different values of DQId may be the same SVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP. The active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP and an active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP \nfor a particular value of DQId may be the same SVC sequence parameter set RBSP. \nWhen the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, any sequence \nparameter set RBSP with the value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the coded \npicture shall have the same content as that of the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the coded picture unless it \nfollows the last access unit of the coded video sequence containing the coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit \nand the first SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message (when present) of another coded video sequence. \nWhen the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set RBSP, any \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSP with the value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active SVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP for the coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the \ncoded picture unless it follows the last access unit of the coded video sequence containing the coded picture and precedes \nthe first VCL NAL unit and the first SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message (when present) of another \ncoded video sequence. \nFor each particular value of DQId, the following applies: \n\u2013  When the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, any \nsequence parameter set RBSP with the value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active layer SVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP for the coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active layer SVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP for the coded picture unless it follows the last access unit of the coded video sequence containing the coded \npicture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit and the first SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message \n(when present) of another coded video sequence. \n\u2013  When the active layer SVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set \nRBSP, any subset sequence parameter set RBSP with the value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active layer SVC \nsequence parameter set RBSP for the coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active layer SVC \n \n\nsequence parameter set RBSP for the coded picture unless it follows the last access unit of the coded video sequence \ncontaining the coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit and the first SEI NAL unit containing a buffering \nperiod SEI message (when present) of another coded video sequence. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 If picture parameter set RBSP or SVC sequence parameter set RBSP are conveyed within the bitstream, these constraints \nimpose an order constraint on the NAL units that contain the picture parameter set RBSP or SVC sequence parameter set RBSP, \nrespectively. Otherwise (picture parameter set RBSP or SVC sequence parameter set RBSP are conveyed by other means not \nspecified in this Recommendation | International Standard), they must be available to the decoding process in a timely fashion such \nthat these constraints are obeyed. \nWhen a sequence parameter set NAL unit with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces \nthe  content  of  the  previous  sequence  parameter  set  NAL  unit,  in  decoding  order,  with  the  same  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id (when a previous sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id \nwas  present  in  the  bitstream).  When  a  subset  sequence  parameter  set  NAL  unit  with  a  particular  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces the content of the previous subset sequence parameter set NAL unit, \nin decoding order, with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id (when a previous subset sequence parameter set NAL unit \nwith the same value of seq_parameter_set_id was present in the bitstream). \nNOTE 7 \u2013 A decoder must be capable of simultaneously storing the contents of the sequence parameter sets and subset sequence \nparameter sets for all values of seq_parameter_set_id. The content of the sequence parameter set with a particular value of \nseq_parameter_set_id is overwritten when a new sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id is \nreceived, and the content of the subset sequence parameter set with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is overwritten when \na new subset sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id is received. \nWhen present, a sequence parameter set extension RBSP includes parameters having a similar function to those of a \nsequence parameter set RBSP. For purposes of establishing constraints on the syntax elements of the sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP and for purposes of determining activation of a sequence parameter set extension RBSP, the sequence \nparameter set extension RBSP shall be considered part of the preceding sequence parameter set RBSP with the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id. When a sequence parameter set RBSP is present that is not followed by a sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id prior to the activation of the sequence parameter set \nRBSP, the sequence parameter set extension RBSP and its syntax elements shall be considered not present for the active \nSVC sequence parameter set RBSP. The contents of sequence parameter set extension RBSPs only apply when the base \nlayer, which conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, of a coded video sequence conforming to one \nor more of the profiles specified in Annex G is decoded. Subset sequence parameter set RBSPs shall not be followed by a \nsequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nNOTE 8 \u2013 Sequence parameter sets extension RBSPs are not considered to be part of a subset sequence parameter set RBSP and \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSPs must not be followed by a sequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nFor layer representations with DQId equal to DQIdMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the \nvalues of the syntax elements (and the values of variables derived from those syntax elements) in SVC sequence parameter \nsets and picture parameter sets and other syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the active SVC \nsequence parameter set and the active picture parameter set. For layer representations with a particular value of DQId less \nthan DQIdMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the values of the syntax elements (and the \nvalues of variables derived from those syntax elements) in SVC sequence parameter sets and picture parameter sets and \nother syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the active layer SVC sequence parameter set and \nthe active layer picture parameter set for the particular value of DQId. If any SVC sequence parameter set RBSP having \nprofile_idc equal to one of the profile_idc values specified in Annex A or G is present that is never activated in the bitstream \n(i.e., it never becomes the active SVC sequence parameter set or an active layer SVC sequence parameter set), its syntax \nelements shall have values that would conform to the specified constraints if it were activated by reference in an otherwise-\nconforming bitstream. If any picture parameter set RBSP is present that is never activated in the bitstream (i.e., it never \nbecomes the active picture parameter set or an active layer picture parameter set), its syntax elements shall have values \nthat would conform to the specified constraints if it were activated by reference in an otherwise-conforming bitstream. \nDuring operation of the decoding process (see clause G.8), for layer representations with DQId equal to DQIdMax, the \nvalues of parameters of the active picture parameter set and the active SVC sequence parameter set shall be considered in \neffect. For layer representations with a particular value of DQId less than DQIdMax, the values of the parameters of the \nactive layer picture parameter set and the active layer SVC sequence parameter set for the particular value of DQId shall \nbe considered in effect. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply to access units or dependency representations with \ndependency_id equal to DependencyIdMax or layer representation with DQId equal to DQIdMax, the values of the \nparameters of the active picture parameter set and the active SVC sequence parameter set for the access unit shall be \nconsidered in effect unless otherwise specified in the SEI message semantics. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply \nto dependency representations with a particular value of dependency_id less than DependencyIdMax, the values of the \nparameters of the active layer picture parameter set and the active layer SVC sequence parameter set for the layer \nrepresentation with DQId equal to ( dependency_id << 4 ) of the access unit shall be considered in effect unless otherwise \nspecified in the SEI message semantics. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply to layer representations with a \nparticular value of DQId less than DQIdMax, the values of the parameters of the active layer picture parameter set and the \nactive layer SVC sequence parameter set for the layer representation with the particular value of DQId of the access unit \nshall be considered in effect unless otherwise specified in the SEI message semantics. \n \n\nG.7.4.1.2.2  Order of access units and association to coded video sequences \nThe specification of clause 7.4.1.2.2 applies with the following modifications. \nThe first access unit of the bitstream shall only contain coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 5 or idr_flag \nequal to 1. \nThe order of NAL units and coded pictures and their association to access units is described in clause G.7.4.1.2.3. \nG.7.4.1.2.3  Order of NAL units and coded pictures and association to access units \nThe specification of clause 7.4.1.2.3 applies with the following modifications. \nNOTE \u2013 Some bitstreams that conform to one or more profiles specified in this annex do not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A (prior to operation of the base layer extraction process specified in clause G.8.8.2). As specified in clauses 7.4.1 \nand 7.4.1.2.3, for the profiles specified in Annex A, NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 20 are classified as non-VCL NAL units \nthat must be preceded within each access unit by at least one NAL unit with nal_unit_type in the range of 1 to 5, inclusive. For this \nreason, any bitstream that conforms to one or more profiles specified in this annex does not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A when it contains any of the following: \n\u2013  any access unit that does not contain any NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5, but contains one or more NAL units \nwith nal_unit_type equal to 6, 7, 8, 9, or 15; \n\u2013  any access unit in which one or more NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 7, 8, or 15 is present after the last NAL unit in the \naccess unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5. \nThe association of VCL NAL units to primary or redundant coded pictures is specified in clause G.7.4.1.2.5. When the \nprimary coded picture does not contain a layer representation with a particular value of DQId, all redundant coded pictures \n(when present) in the same access unit shall not contain a layer representation with the particular value of DQId. \nThe constraints for the detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture are specified in clause G.7.4.1.2.4. \nThe constraint expressed in clause 7.4.1.2.3 on the order of a buffering period SEI message is replaced by the following \nconstraints. \n\u2013  When an SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message is present, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the buffering period SEI message is the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit and it is not \nincluded in a scalable nesting SEI message, the buffering period SEI message shall be the first SEI message \npayload of the first SEI NAL unit in the access unit. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the buffering period SEI message is not the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit or \nit is included in a scalable nesting SEI message), the following constraints are specified: \n\u2013  When a buffering period SEI message that is not included in a scalable nesting SEI message is present, this \nbuffering period SEI message shall be the only SEI message payload of the first SEI NAL unit in the access \nunit. \n\u2013  A scalable nesting SEI message that includes a buffering period SEI message shall not include any other \nSEI messages and the scalable nesting SEI message that includes a buffering period SEI message shall be \nthe only SEI message inside an SEI NAL unit. \n\u2013  All SEI NAL units that precede an SEI NAL unit that contains a scalable nesting SEI message with a \nbuffering period SEI message as payload in an access unit shall only contain buffering period SEI messages \nor scalable nesting SEI messages with a buffering period SEI message as payload. \n\u2013  When present, a scalable nesting SEI message with all_layer_representations_in_au_flag equal to 1 and a \nbuffering period SEI message as payload shall be the first scalable nesting SEI message in an access unit. \n\u2013  Any scalable nesting SEI message with a buffering period SEI message as payload that immediately \nprecedes another scalable nesting SEI message with a buffering period SEI message as payload shall have \nvalues of 128 * sei_dependency_id[ i ] + 8 * sei_quality_id[ i ] + sei_temporal_id, for all present i, that are \nless than any of the values of 128 * sei_dependency_id[ i ] + 8 * sei_quality_id[ i ] + sei_temporal_id in the \nimmediately following scalable nesting SEI message with a buffering period SEI message as payload. \nThe following additional constraints shall be obeyed: \n\u2013  Each NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 shall be immediately preceded by a prefix NAL unit. \n\u2013  In  bitstreams  conforming  to  this  Recommendation | International Standard,  each  prefix  NAL  unit  shall  be \nimmediately followed by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5. \nG.7.4.1.2.4  Detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture \nThis clause specifies constraints on VCL NAL unit syntax that are sufficient to enable the detection of the first VCL NAL \nunit of each primary coded picture. \n \n\nThe first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit, in decoding order, shall be different from \nthe last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit, in decoding order, in one or more of the \nfollowing ways: \n\u2013  dependency_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is less than \ndependency_id of the last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit \n\u2013  dependency_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is equal to \ndependency_id of the last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit and any of the \nfollowing conditions are true \n\u2013  quality_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is less than quality_id \nof the last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit \n\u2013  quality_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit and the last VCL \nNAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit is equal to 0, and any of the conditions \nspecified in clause 7.4.1.2.4 is fulfilled \nG.7.4.1.2.5  Order of VCL NAL units and association to coded pictures \nEach VCL NAL unit is part of a coded picture. \nLet dId be the value of dependency_id and let qId be the value of quality_id of any particular VCL NAL unit. The order \nof the VCL NAL units within a coded picture is constrained as follows: \n\u2013  For all VCL NAL units following this particular VCL NAL unit, the value of dependency_id shall be greater than or \nequal to dId. \n\u2013  For all VCL NAL units with a value of dependency_id equal to dId following this particular VCL NAL unit, the value \nof quality_id shall be greater than or equal to qId. \nFor each set of VCL NAL units within a layer representation, the following applies: \n\u2013  If arbitrary slice order, as specified in Annex A or clause G.10, is allowed, coded slice NAL units of a layer \nrepresentation may have any order relative to each other. \n\u2013  Otherwise (arbitrary slice order is not allowed), coded slice NAL units of a slice group shall not be interleaved with \ncoded slice NAL units of another slice group and the order of coded slice NAL units within a slice group shall be in \nthe order of increasing macroblock address for the first macroblock of each coded slice NAL unit of the same slice \ngroup. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 12 may be present in the access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL \nunit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive, which are unspecified, may be present in \nthe access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type in the range of 21 to 23, inclusive, which are reserved, shall not precede the first VCL \nNAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit (when specified in the future by ITU-T | ISO/IEC). \nG.7.4.2 Raw byte sequence payloads and RBSP trailing bits semantics \nG.7.4.2.1  Sequence parameter set RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1 apply. \nG.7.4.2.1.1  Sequence parameter set data semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.1 apply with substituting SVC sequence parameter set for sequence parameter \nset.

Each cabac_zero_word is represented in a NAL unit by the three-byte sequence 0x000003 (as a result of \nthe  constraints  on  NAL  unit  contents  that  result  in  requiring  inclusion  of  an  emulation_prevention_three_byte  for  each \ncabac_zero_word). \nG.7.4.2.11 RBSP trailing bits semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.11 apply. \nG.7.4.2.12 Prefix NAL unit RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.12 apply. \nG.7.4.2.12.1 Prefix NAL unit SVC semantics \nThe syntax element store_ref_base_pic_flag is considered as if it was present in the associated NAL unit. \nstore_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that, when the value of dependency_id as specified in the NAL unit header \nis equal to the maximum value of dependency_id for the VCL NAL units of the current coded picture, an additional \nrepresentation of the coded picture that may or may not be identical to the decoded picture is marked as \"used for \nreference\".

indicate that all slices of a layer representation have \nthe same value of (slice_type % 5). Values of slice_type in the range 5..7 are otherwise equivalent to corresponding values in the \nrange 0..2. \nWhen idr_flag is equal to 1 or max_num_ref_frames is equal to 0, slice_type shall be equal to 2 or 7. \nIn the text (in particular when the clauses 7 to 9 are referenced in this annex), slices with ( slice_type % 5 ) equal to 0, 1, \nand 2 may be collectively referred to as P, B, and I slices, respectively, regardless of whether the slices are coded using \nNAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 20 (slice_type is present in the slice_header_in_scalable_extension( ) syntax \nstructure) or NAL units with nal_unit_type in the range of 1 to 5, inclusive (slice_type is present in the slice_header( ) \nsyntax structure). \npic_parameter_set_id has the same semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. \ncolour_plane_id has the same semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. \nframe_num  is  used  as  an  identifier  for  dependency  representations  and  shall  be  represented  by \nlog2_max_frame_num_minus4 + 4 bits in the bitstream. \nframe_num is constrained as specified in clause 7.4.3. For this specification, the modifications a) to f) specified in the first \nparagraph of this clause apply. \nfield_pic_flag and bottom_field_flag have the same semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. For this specification, the \nmodifications a) to d) specified in the first paragraph of this clause apply. \nidr_pic_id identifies an IDR picture when dependency_id is equal to the maximum present value of dependency_id in the \nVCL NAL units of the current coded picture. The value of idr_pic_id shall be in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. \nWhen two consecutive access units in decoding order are both IDR access units, the value of idr_pic_id in the slices of the \ntarget dependency representation in the primary coded pictures of the first such IDR access unit shall differ from the \nidr_pic_id in the slices of the target dependency representation in the primary coded pictures of the second such IDR access \nunit. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The classification of an access unit as IDR access unit depends on the maximum present value of dependency_id. When \nNAL units are removed from a bitstream, e.g. in order to adjust the bitstream to the capabilities of a receiving device, the \nclassification of access units as IDR access units may change. Since all bitstreams for different conformance points supported in a \nscalable  bitstream  (in  particular  for  different  maximum  values  of  dependency_id)  must  conform  to  this \nRecommendation | International Standard (as specified in clause G.8.8.1), the constraints on idr_pic_id must be obeyed for all \nconformance points contained in a scalable bitstream. \npic_order_cnt_lsb, delta_pic_order_cnt_bottom, delta_pic_order_cnt[ 0 ], and delta_pic_order_cnt[ 1 ] have the \nsame semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. For this specification, the modifications a) to f) specified in the first paragraph \nof this clause apply. \nredundant_pic_cnt has the same semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. For this specification, the modifications a) to g) \nspecified in the first paragraph of this clause apply. \ndirect_spatial_mv_pred_flag specifies the method used in the decoding process to derive motion vectors and reference \nindices for inter prediction. When quality_id is greater than 0, direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag is inferred as specified in the \nbeginning of this clause. The value of direct_spatial_mv_pred_flag shall be equal to 1. \nnum_ref_idx_active_override_flag, num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1, and num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 have the \nsame semantics as specified in clause 7.4.3. When quality_id is greater than 0, num_ref_idx_active_override_flag, \nnum_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1, and num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 are inferred as specified in the beginning of this \nclause. \nbase_pred_weight_table_flag  equal  to 1  specifies  that  the  variables  for  weighted  prediction  are  inferred.  When \nbase_pred_weight_table_flag is not present, it shall be inferred as follows: \n\u2013  If quality_id is greater than 0, base_pred_weight_table_flag is inferred as specified in the beginning of this clause. \n\u2013  Otherwise (quality_id is equal to 0), base_pred_weight_table_flag is inferred to be equal to 0. \nWhen base_pred_weight_table_flag is equal to 1 and quality_id is equal to 0, let refSetOfSlices be the set of slices that is \nrepresented by the VCL NAL units with dependency_id equal to (ref_layer_dq_id >> 4) and quality_id equal to 0 inside \nthe current coded picture. \nWhen base_pred_weight_table_flag is equal to 1 and quality_id is equal to 0, the following constraints shall be obeyed: \na)  For all slices in refSetOfSlices, the value of (slice_type % 5) shall be equal to (slice_type % 5) of the current \nslice. \nb)  base_pred_weight_table_flag shall have the same value in all slices in refSetOfSlices. \n \n\nc)  When the syntax structure pred_weight_table( ) is present in the slices of the set refSetOfSlices, the values of all \nsyntax elements inside the syntax structure pred_weight_table( ) shall be the same for all slices in refSetOfSlices. \nd)  When the current slice is an EP slice, the following applies: \ni)  The value of num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 of all slices in refSetOfSlices shall be identical to the value of \nnum_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 of the current slice. \nii)  For each slice in refSetOfSlices, the syntax elements inside the syntax structure ref_pic_list_modification( ) \nshall be the same, and the syntax structure ref_pic_list_modification( ) for the slices in refSetOfSlices shall \ncontain syntax elements so that for useRefBasePicFlag equal to 0 and 1, an invocation of clause G.8.2.3 with \ncurrDependencyId set equal to (ref_layer_dq_id >> 4), useRefBasePicFlag, and any slice of refSetOfSlices \nas the inputs derives a reference picture list refPicList0RefLayer that is identical to the reference picture list \nrefPicList0,  which  is  derived  by  invoking  clause G.8.2.3  with  currDependencyId  set  equal  to \ndependency_id, useRefBasePicFlag, and the current slice as the inputs. The entries of two reference picture \nlists are considered the same when they represent entries that correspond to same coded frame, the same \ncomplementary reference field pair, the same coded field, or the same field of a coded frame. \niii)  weighted_pred_flag shall be equal to 1 for the slices in refSetOfSlices. \ne)  When the current slice is an EB slice, the following applies: \ni)  The  values  of  num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1  and  num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1  of  all  slices  in \nrefSetOfSlices  shall  be  identical  to  the  values  of  num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1  and \nnum_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1, respectively, of the current slice. \nii)  For each slice in refSetOfSlices, the syntax elements inside the syntax structure ref_pic_list_modification( ) \nshall be the same, and the syntax structure ref_pic_list_modification( ) for the slices in refSetOfSlices shall \ncontain syntax elements so that for useRefBasePicFlag equal to 0 and 1, an invocation of clause G.8.2.3 with \ncurrDependencyId set equal to (ref_layer_dq_id >> 4), useRefBasePicFlag, and any slice of refSetOfSlices \nas the inputs derives reference picture lists refPicList0RefLayer and refPicList1RefLayer that are identical \nto the reference picture lists refPicList0 and refPicList1, respectively, which are derived by invoking \nclause G.8.2.3 with currDependencyId set equal to dependency_id, useRefBasePicFlag, and the current slice \nas the inputs. The entries of two reference picture lists are considered the same when they represent entries \nthat correspond to same coded frame, the same complementary reference field pair, the same coded field, or \nthe same field of a coded frame. \niii)  weighted_bipred_idc shall be equal to 1 for the slices in refSetOfSlices. \nstore_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that, when the value of dependency_id is equal to the maximum value of \ndependency_id for the VCL NAL units of the current coded picture, an additional representation of the coded picture that \nmay or may not be identical to the decoded picture is marked as \"used for reference\".

The modifications a) and b) specified in \nclause G.8.2 apply with currDependencyId being equal to the current value of dependency_id. \nThe  syntax  elements  adaptive_ref_base_pic_marking_mode_flag,  memory_management_base_control_operation, \ndifference_of_base_pic_nums_minus1, and long_term_base_pic_num specify marking of reference base pictures as \n\"unused for reference\". \nWhen present in a prefix NAL unit, all syntax elements of the dec_ref_base_pic_marking( ) syntax structure are considered \nas if they were present in the associated NAL unit. \nWhen quality_id is greater than 0, all syntax elements of the dec_ref_base_pic_marking( ) syntax structure are inferred as \nspecified in the beginning of clause G.7.4.3.4. \nThe content of the decoded reference picture base marking syntax structure shall be the same in all slice headers of the \nprimary coded picture.

The values and control \noperations  associated  with  memory_management_base_control_operation  are  specified  in  Table G-3.  The \nmemory_management_base_control_operation syntax elements are processed by the decoding process in the order in \nwhich they appear, and the semantics constraints expressed for each memory_management_base_control_operation apply \nat the specific position in that order at which that individual memory_management_base_control_operation is processed. \n \n\nFor interpretation of memory_management_base_control_operation, the terms reference picture and reference base picture \nare interpreted as follows: \n\u2013  If the current picture is a frame, the term reference picture refers either to a reference frame or a complementary \nreference field pair and the term reference base picture refers either to a reference base frame or a complementary \nreference base field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture is a field), the term reference picture refers either to a reference field or a field of a \nreference frame and the term reference base picture refers either to a reference base field or a field of a reference base \nframe. \nmemory_management_base_control_operation shall not be equal to 1 unless the specified reference base picture is marked \nas  \"used  for  short-term  reference\"  (and  as  \"reference  base  picture\")  when  the \nmemory_management_base_control_operation is processed by the decoding process. \nmemory_management_base_control_operation shall not be equal to 2 unless the specified long-term picture number refers \nto a reference base picture that is marked as \"used for long-term reference\" (and as \"reference base picture\") when the \nmemory_management_base_control_operation is processed by the decoding process. \nWhen  the  dec_ref_pic_marking( )  syntax  structure  contains  a  memory_management_control_operation  equal  to 5, \nmemory_management_base_control_operation shall not be equal to 1 or 2. \nTable G-3 \u2013 Memory management base control operation (memory_management_base_control_operation) values \nmemory_management_base_control_operation  Memory Management Base Control Operation \n0  End  memory_management_base_control_operation \nsyntax element loop \n1  Mark  a  short-term  reference  base  picture  as \n\"unused for reference\" \n2  Mark  a  long-term  reference  base  picture  as \n\"unused for reference\" \ndifference_of_base_pic_nums_minus1 is used (with memory_management_base_control_operation equal to 1) to mark \na  short-term  reference  base  picture  as  \"unused  for  reference\".

For these invocations of the process specified in clause 8.2.1, the modifications a) and b) specified in \nclause G.8.2 apply with currDependencyId being equal to dependency_id of the corresponding dependency representation. \nFor  all  dependency  representations  of  the  set  depRepSet  for  an  access  unit,  either  TopFieldOrderCnt  or \nBottomFieldOrderCnt or both are derived. When both are derived in two or more dependency representations of an access \nunit, their difference shall be the same in these dependency representations of the access unit. \nThe values of TopFieldOrderCnt and BottomFieldOrderCnt are restricted as specified in the following ordered steps: \n1.  The set depRepSet for an access unit is the set depRepSet that has been derived in the process specified in this \nclause for the corresponding access unit. \n2.  For each access unit, the one-dimensional array picOrderCnt is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If TopFieldOrderCnt is derived for all dependency representations of the set depRepSet for an access unit, \nfor each dependency representation of the set depRepSet for this access unit, the variable picOrderCnt[ dId ] \nis  set  equal  to  TopFieldOrderCnt  with  dId  being  the  value  of  dependency_id  for  the  dependency \nrepresentation. \n\u2013  Otherwise (TopFieldOrderCnt is not derived for all dependency representations of the set depRepSet for an \naccess unit), for each dependency representation of the set depRepSet for this access unit, the variable \npicOrderCnt[ dId ] is set equal to BottomFieldOrderCnt with dId being the value of dependency_id for the \ndependency representation. \n3.  Let au0 and au1 be any pair of access units in the bitstream with au1 being later in decoding order than au0. \n4.  Let the flag idrConditionFlag be derived for each dependency representation of the set depRepSet for an access \nunit as follows: \n\u2013  If  the  dependency  representation  in  the  access  unit  has  IdrPicFlag  equal  to  1  or  a \nmemory_management_control_operation syntax element equal to 5, idrConditionFlag is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the dependency representation in the access unit has IdrPicFlag equal to 0 and does not have a \nmemory_management_control_operation syntax element equal to 5), idrConditionFlag is set equal to 0. \n5.  Let the set dIdSet0 be the set of all dependency_id values of the set depRepSet for au0. \n6.  Let the set dIdSet1 be the set of all dependency_id values of the set depRepSet for au1 for which idrConditionFlag \nis not equal to 1 in any access unit in decoding order between the access unit that follows au0 and the access unit \nau1, inclusive. \n \n\n7.  For all values of dId that are present in both sets dIdSet0 and dIdSet1, the differences between the value \npicOrderCnt[ dId ] in au0 and the value picOrderCnt[ dId ] in au1 shall be the same. \nG.8.2.2 SVC decoding process for picture numbers \nThis process is invoked when the SVC decoding process for reference picture lists construction specified in clause G.8.2.3, \nthe SVC reference picture marking process for a dependency representation specified in clause G.8.2.4.1, or the SVC \ndecoding process for gaps in frame_num specified in clause G.8.2.5 is invoked. \nInputs to this process are: \n\u2013  a variable currDependencyId specifying a dependency representation, \n\u2013  a  variable  refPicListConstructionFlag  specifying  whether  this  process  is  invoked  for  reference  picture  lists \nconstruction, \n\u2013  when refPicListConstructionFlag is equal to 1, a variable useRefBasePicFlag specifying whether reference base \npictures are considered for reference picture lists construction. \nFrom here to the end of this clause, the modifications a) and b) specified in clause G.8.2 apply. \nThe variables FrameNum, FrameNumWrap, and PicNum are assigned to all short-term reference pictures and the variables \nLongTermFrameIdx and LongTermPicNum are assigned to all long-term reference pictures by invoking the decoding \nprocess for picture numbers as specified in clause 8.2.4.1. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 For this invocation of the process specified in clause 8.2.4.1, the pictures marked as \"reference base pictures\" and the \npictures not marked as \"reference base pictures\" are taken into account. \nFor the following specification of this clause, reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired \nreference fields with at least one field marked as \"used for reference\" are referred to as reference entries. When only one \nfield of a reference entry is marked as \"used for reference\", the reference entry is considered to have the same marking(s) \nand the same assigned variables as its field marked as \"used for reference\". When a reference entry is marked as \"not \navailable for reference list construction\" in the following process, both of its fields are also marked as \"not available for \nreference list construction\". \nWhen refPicListConstructionFlag is equal to 1, the following applies: \n\u2013  If useRefBasePicFlag is equal to 0, all reference entries that are marked as \"reference base picture\" are marked as \"not \navailable for reference list construction\". \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When useRefBasePicFlag is equal to 0, only reference entries that are not marked as \"reference base picture\" are \nconsidered as present for the purpose of reference picture lists construction. \n\u2013  Otherwise (useRefBasePicFlag is equal to 1), all reference entries for which one of the following conditions is true \nare marked as \"not available for reference list construction\": \n\u2013  the reference entry is not marked as \"reference base picture\", the reference entry is marked as \"used for \nshort-term reference\", and there exists a reference entry with the same value of FrameNum that is marked as \n\"reference base picture\" and \"used for short-term reference\", \n\u2013  the reference entry is not marked as \"reference base picture\", the reference entry is marked as \"used for \nlong-term reference\", and there exists a reference entry with the same value of LongTermFrameIdx that is \nmarked as \"reference base picture\" and \"used for long-term reference\". \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When useRefBasePicFlag is equal to 1 and either two short-term reference entries have the same value of FrameNum \nor two long-term reference entries have the same value of LongTermFrameIdx (one of these reference entries is marked as \n\"reference base picture\" and the other reference entry is not marked as \"reference base picture\"), only the reference entry marked \nas \"reference base picture\" is considered as present for the purpose of reference picture lists construction. \nG.8.2.3 SVC decoding process for reference picture lists construction \nThis process is invoked at the beginning of the decoding process for each P, EP, B, or EB slice. \nInputs to this process are: \n\u2013  a variable currDependencyId, \n\u2013  a variable useRefBasePicFlag, \n\u2013  the current slice currSlice. \nOutputs of this process are: \n\u2013  a reference picture list refPicList0, \n\u2013  for B and EB slices, a reference picture list refPicList1. \n \n\nAfter applying the process described in this clause, the output reference picture lists refPicList0 and refPicList1 (when \napplicable) shall not contain any pictures for which the syntax element temporal_id is greater than the syntax element \ntemporal_id of the current picture. \nFrom here to the end of this clause, the modifications a) and b) specified in clause G.8.2 apply. \nUnless stated otherwise, the syntax elements and derived upper-case variables that are referred to by the process specified \nin this clause and all child processes invoked from this process are the syntax elements and derived upper-case variables \nfor the slice header of the current slice currSlice, the current picture parameter, which is identified by the syntax element \npic_parameter_set_id inside the slice header of the current slice currSlice, and the current sequence parameter, which is \nidentified by the syntax element seq_parameter_set_id inside the current picture parameter set. \nA variable biPred is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If the current slice currSlice is a B or EB slice, biPred is set equal to 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, biPred is set equal to 0. \nDecoded reference pictures are marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \"used for long-term reference\" as specified \nby the bitstream and specified in clause G.8.2.4. Short-term reference pictures are identified by the value of frame_num \nthat is decoded in the slice header(s) with dependency_id equal to currDependencyId. Long-term reference pictures are \nidentified by a long-term frame index as specified by the bitstream and specified in clause G.8.2.4. \nClause G.8.2.2 is invoked with currDependencyId, refPicListConstructionFlag equal to 1, and useRefBasePicFlag as inputs \nto specify the following: \n\u2013  the assignment of variables FrameNum, FrameNumWrap, and PicNum to each of the short-term reference pictures, \n\u2013  the assignment of variables LongTermPicNum to each of the long-term reference pictures, \n\u2013  the marking of reference pictures that are not used for reference picture lists construction as \"not available for \nreference list construction\" (depending on the value of useRefBasePicFlag). \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The marking of reference pictures as \"not available for reference list construction\" is removed after construction of the \nreference picture lists. \nReference pictures are addressed through reference indices as specified in clause 8.4.2.1 with the modification e) specified \nin clause G.8.4.2. A reference index is an index into a reference picture list. When biPred is equal to 0, a single reference \npicture list refPicList0 is constructed. When decoding a B or EB slice (biPred is equal to 1), a second independent reference \npicture list refPicList1 is constructed in addition to refPicList0. \nAt the beginning of the decoding process for each slice, reference picture list refPicList0, and for biPred equal to 1 \nrefPicList1, are derived as specified in the following ordered steps: \n1.  Initial reference picture lists RefPicList0 and, for biPred equal to 1, RefPicList1 are derived by invoking the \ninitialization process for reference picture lists as specified in clause 8.2.4.2. During the initialization process in \nclause 8.2.4.2 all reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields that have \nbeen marked as \"not available for reference list construction\" by the invocation of clause G.8.2.2 are considered as \nnot present. \n2.  When ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l0 is equal to 1 or, when decoding a B or EB slice (biPred is equal to 1), \nref_pic_list_modification_flag_l1 is equal to 1, the initial reference picture list RefPicList0 and for biPred equal \nto 1 RefPicList1 are modified by invoking the modification process for reference picture lists as specified in \nclause 8.2.4.3. During the modification process in clause 8.2.4.3 all reference frames, complementary reference \nfield pairs, and non-paired reference fields that have been marked as \"not available for reference list construction\" \nby the invocation of clause G.8.2.2 are considered as not present. \n3.  RefPicList0 is assigned to refPicList0. \n4.  When biPred is equal to 1, RefPicList1 is assigned to refPicList1. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 By the invocation of the process in clause G.8.2.2 some reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-\npaired reference fields might have been marked as \"not available for reference list construction\". Since, these pictures are not \nconsidered in the construction process for reference picture lists, the reference picture lists refPicList0 and, for biPred equal to 1, \nrefPicList1 are dependent on the value of the input parameter useRefBasePicFlag. \nThe number of entries in the modified reference picture list refPicList0 is num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 + 1, and for \nbiPred  equal  to 1  the  number  of  entries  in  the  modified  reference  picture  list  refPicList1  is \nnum_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 + 1. A reference picture may appear at more than one index in the modified reference \npicture lists refPicList0 or refPicList1. \nFor all reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields that have been marked as \n\"not available for reference list construction\" during the invocation of clause G.8.2.2, this marking is removed. \n \n\nG.8.2.4 SVC decoded reference picture marking process \nInput to this process is a list dqIdList of integer values specifying layer representation identifiers. \nLet depRepSet be the set of dependency representations for which all of the following conditions are true: \n\u2013  the list dqIdList contains the value (dependency_id << 4), \n\u2013  nal_ref_idc is greater than 0. \nFor each dependency representation of the set depRepSet, the SVC reference picture marking process for a dependency \nrepresentation as specified in clause G.8.2.4.1 is invoked. For these invocations of the process specified in clause G.8.2.4.1, \nthe modifications a) and b) specified in clause G.8.2 apply with currDependencyId being equal to dependency_id for the \ncorresponding dependency representation. \nG.8.2.4.1  SVC reference picture marking process for a dependency representation \nInput to this process is a variable currDependencyId. \nOutput of this process is a modified reference picture marking for dependency representations with dependency_id equal \nto currDependencyId. \nThis process is invoked for a decoded picture when nal_ref_idc is not equal to 0 for the dependency representation with \ndependency_id being equal to currDependencyId. \nAll syntax elements and derived upper-case variables that are referred to by the process specified in this clause and all \nchild processes invoked from this process are syntax elements and derived upper-case variables for the dependency \nrepresentation with dependency_id equal to currDependencyId. \nA decoded picture with nal_ref_idc not equal to 0, referred to as a reference picture, is marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\" or \"used for long-term reference\". When store_ref_base_pic_flag is equal to 1, a second representation of the \ndecoded picture also referred to as reference base picture is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \"used for \nlong-term reference\" and additionally marked as \"reference base picture\". Pictures that are marked as \"reference base \npicture\" are only used as references for inter prediction of following pictures with use_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 1. These \npictures are not used for inter prediction of pictures with use_ref_base_pic_flag equal to 0, and these pictures do not \nrepresent an output of the decoding process. \nFor a decoded reference frame, both of its fields are marked the same as the frame. For a complementary reference field \npair, the pair is marked the same as both of its fields. A picture that is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" is identified \nby its FrameNum and, when it is a field, by its parity, and, when it is a reference base picture, by the marking \"reference \nbase picture\". A picture that is marked as \"used for long-term reference\" is identified by its LongTermFrameIdx and, when \nit is a field, by its parity, and, when it is a reference base picture, by the marking \"reference base picture\". \nWhile decoded pictures are represented by the sample arrays S  and, when ChromaArrayType is not equal to 0, S  and \nL Cb\nS , reference base pictures are represented by the sample arrays B  and, when ChromaArrayType is not equal to 0, B  \nCr L Cb\nand B . When reference base pictures are referenced in the inter prediction process via clause 8.4.2.1, the samples arrays \nCr\nB , B , and B  are referred to as S , S , and S , respectively. The sample arrays S , S , S , B , B , and B  that \nL Cb Cr L Cb Cr L Cb Cr L Cb Cr\nreferenced in the inter prediction process via clause 8.4.2.1 are constructed as specified in clause G.8. Reference base \npictures are associated with the same descriptive information such as the variables FrameNum, FrameNumWrap, PicNum, \nLongTermFrameIdx, and LongTermPicNum as decoded pictures. \nFrames or complementary field pairs marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or as \"used for long-term reference\" can \nbe used as a reference for inter prediction when decoding a frame until the frame, the complementary field pair, or one of \nits constituent fields is marked as \"unused for reference\". A field marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or as \"used for \nlong-term reference\" can be used as a reference for inter prediction when decoding a field until marked as \"unused for \nreference\". \nA picture can be marked as \"unused for reference\" by the sliding window reference picture marking process, a first-in, \nfirst-out mechanism specified in clause G.8.2.4.2, or by the adaptive memory control reference picture marking process, a \ncustomised adaptive marking operation specified in clauses G.8.2.4.3 and G.8.2.4.4. \nA short-term reference picture is identified for use in the decoding process by its variables FrameNum and FrameNumWrap \nand its picture number PicNum, and, when it is a reference base picture, by the marking as \"reference base picture\". A \nlong-term reference picture is identified for use in the decoding process by its variable LongTermFrameIdx, its long-term \npicture number LongTermPicNum, and, when it is a reference base picture, by the marking as \"reference base picture\". \nWhen the current picture is not an IDR picture, the variables FrameNum, FrameNumWrap, PicNum, LongTermFrameIdx, \nand LongTermPicNum are assigned to the reference pictures by invoking the SVC decoding process for picture numbers \nas specified in clause G.8.2.2 with currDependencyId and refPicListConstructionFlag set equal to 0 as the inputs. \nDecoded reference picture marking proceeds in the following ordered steps: \n \n\n1.  All slices of the current access unit are decoded. \n2.  Depending on the current picture, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the current picture is an IDR picture, the following ordered steps are specified: \na.  All reference pictures are marked as \"unused for reference\". \nb.  Depending on long_term_reference_flag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If long_term_reference_flag is equal to 0, the following ordered steps are specified: \ni.  The IDR picture is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" and MaxLongTermFrameIdx \nis set equal to \"no long-term frame indices\". \nii.  When store_ref_base_pic_flag is equal to 1, the reference base picture of the IDR picture is \nmarked as \"used for short-term reference\" and as \"reference base picture\". \n\u2013  Otherwise (long_term_reference_flag is equal to 1), the following ordered steps are specified: \ni.  The IDR picture is marked as \"used for long-term reference\", the LongTermFrameIdx for the \nIDR picture is set equal to 0, and MaxLongTermFrameIdx is set equal to 0. \nii.  When store_ref_base_pic_flag is equal to 1, the reference base picture of the IDR picture is \nmarked  as  \"used  for  long-term  reference\"  and  as  \"reference  base  picture\",  and  the \nLongTermFrameIdx for the reference base picture of the IDR picture is set equal to 0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current picture is not an IDR picture), the following ordered steps are specified: \na.  When adaptive_ref_base_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 1, the SVC adaptive memory control \nreference base picture marking process as specified in clause G.8.2.4.3 is invoked. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 By this invocation of the process specified in clause G.8.2.4.3, pictures that are marked as \"used \nfor reference\" and \"reference base picture\" can be marked as \"unused for reference\". \nWith currTId being the value of temporal_id for the current access unit, the bitstream shall not contain \ndata that result in the marking of pictures with temporal_id less currTId as \"unused for reference\" during \nthis invocation of the process in clause G.8.2.4.3. \nb.  Depending on adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 1, the SVC adaptive memory control decoded \nreference picture marking process as specified in clause G.8.2.4.4 is invoked. \nWith currTId being the value of temporal_id for the current access unit, the bitstream shall not \ncontain data that result in the marking of pictures with temporal_id less currTId as \"unused for \nreference\" during this invocation of the process in clause G.8.2.4.4. \n\u2013  Otherwise (adaptive_ref_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 0), the SVC sliding window decoded \nreference picture marking process as specified in clause G.8.2.4.2 is invoked with refBasePicFlag \nequal to 0 as the input. \nc.  When  the  current  picture  was  not  marked  as  \"used  for  long-term  reference\"  by  a \nmemory_management_control_operation command equal to 6, the current picture is marked as \"used \nfor short-term reference\" and, when the current picture is the second field (in decoding order) of a \ncomplementary reference field pair and the first field is marked as \"used for short-term reference\", the \ncomplementary field pair is also marked as \"used for short-term reference\". \nd.  When store_ref_base_pic_flag is equal to 1 and the reference base picture for the current picture was \nnot marked as \"used for long-term reference\" by a memory_management_control_operation command \nequal to 6, the following ordered steps are specified: \ni.  When adaptive_ref_base_pic_marking_mode_flag is equal to 0, the following ordered steps are \nspecified: \n(1)  The SVC decoding process for picture numbers as specified in clause G.8.2.2 is invoked with \ncurrDependencyId and refPicListConstructionFlag set equal to 0 as the inputs. \n(2)  The SVC sliding  window decoded reference picture  marking process as specified in \nclause G.8.2.4.2 is invoked with refBasePicFlag equal to 1 as the input. \nii.  The reference base picture of the current picture is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" and \nas \"reference base picture\" and, when the reference base picture of the current picture is the second \nreference base field (in decoding order) of a complementary reference base field pair and the first \n \n\nreference base field is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" (and \"reference base picture\"), \nthe complementary reference base field pair is also marked as \"used for short-term reference\" and \n\"reference base picture\". \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When both the decoded picture and the reference base picture for an access unit (including the current access unit) \nare marked as \"used for reference\", either both pictures are marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or both pictures are \nmarked as \"used for long-term reference\" after the completion of the process specified in this clause. And in the latter case, \nthe same value of LongTermFrameIdx is assigned to both pictures. \nIt is a requirement of bitstream conformance that, after marking the current decoded reference picture and, when \nstore_ref_base_pic_flag is equal to 1, the current reference base picture, the total number of frames with at least one field \nmarked as \"used for reference\", plus the number of complementary field pairs with at least one field marked as \"used for \nreference\",  plus  the  number  of  non-paired  fields  marked  as  \"used  for  reference\"  shall  not  be  greater  than \nMax( max_num_ref_frames, 1 ). \nNOTE 3 \u2013 For this constraint, the pictures marked as \"reference base pictures\" and the pictures not marked as \"reference base \npicture\" are taken into account. \nG.8.2.4.2  SVC sliding window decoded reference picture marking process \nInput to this process is a variable refBasePicFlag. \nThe variable newFrameBufferFlag is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If one of the following conditions is true, newFrameBufferFlag is set equal to 0: \n\u2013  refBasePicFlag is equal to 0, the current picture is a coded field that is the second field in decoding order of a \ncomplementary reference field pair, and the first field of the complementary reference field pair has been marked \nas \"used for short-term reference\", \n\u2013  refBasePicFlag is equal to 1, the current reference base picture is a reference base field that is the second field in \ndecoding order of a complementary reference base field pair, and the first field has been marked as \"used for \nshort-term reference\" (and \"reference base picture\"). \n\u2013  Otherwise, newFrameBufferFlag is set equal to 1. \nWhen newFrameBufferFlag is equal to 1, the following ordered steps are specified: \n1.  Let numShortTerm be the total number of reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired \nreference fields for which at least one field is marked as \"used for short-term reference\". Let numLongTerm be \nthe total number of reference frames, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields for \nwhich at least one field is marked as \"used for long-term reference\". \nNOTE 1 \u2013 For this derivation of numShortTerm and numLongTerm, the pictures marked as \"reference base pictures\" \nand the pictures not marked as \"reference base picture\" are taken into account. \n2.  When numShortTerm + numLongTerm is equal to Max( max_num_ref_frames, 1 ), the following ordered steps \nare specified: \na.  The condition that numShortTerm is greater than 0 shall be fulfilled. \nb.  Let frameNumWrapDecPic be the smallest value of FrameNumWrap that is assigned to reference frames, \ncomplementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields that are marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\" and not marked as \"reference base pictures\". When there doesn't exist any reference frame, \ncomplementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field that is marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\"  and  not  marked  as  \"reference  base  picture\",  frameNumWrapDecPic  is  set  equal  to \nMaxFrameNum. \nc.  Let frameNumWrapBasePic be the smallest value of FrameNumWrap that is assigned to reference frames, \ncomplementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields that are marked as \"used for short-\nterm reference\" and marked as \"reference base pictures\". When there doesn't exist any reference frame, \ncomplementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field that is marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\" and marked as \"reference base picture\", frameNumWrapBasePic is set equal to MaxFrameNum. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The value of MaxFrameNum is greater than all values of FrameNumWrap that are assigned to reference \nframes, complementary reference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields marked as \"used for short-term \nreference. \nd.  The short-term reference frame, complementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field picX is \nderived as follows: \n\u2013  If frameNumWrapDecPic is less than frameNumWrapBasePic, picX is the short-term reference frame, \ncomplementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field that has the value of FrameNumWrap \nequal to frameNumWrapDecPic (and is not marked as \"reference base picture\"). \n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise (frameNumWrapDecPic is greater than or equal to frameNumWrapBasePic), picX is the \nshort-term reference frame, complementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field that has \nthe value of FrameNumWrap equal to frameNumWrapBasePic and is marked as \"reference base \npicture\". \ne.  It is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the short-term reference frame, complementary reference \nfield pair, or non-paired reference field picX shall not be the current picture or the complementary field pair \nthat contains the current picture. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When refBasePicFlag is equal to 1, the current picture has been marked as \"used for short-term \nreference\" in the same invocation of the process specified in clause G.8.2.4.1. \nf.  The short-term reference frame, complementary reference field pair, or non-paired reference field picX is \nmarked as \"unused for reference\".

This base layer bitstream is derived by invoking the sub-bitstream extraction \nprocess as specified in clause G.8.8.1 with dIdTarget being equal to 0 and qIdTarget being equal to 0 and the base layer \nbitstream being the output. \nNOTE \u2013 Although all scalable bitstreams that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in this annex contain a base layer \nbitstream that conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, the complete scalable bitstream (prior to operation of \nthe base layer extraction process specified in this clause) may not conform to any profile specified in Annex A. \n \n\nG.9  Parsing process \nInputs to this process are bits from the RBSP, a request for a value of a syntax element, and values of prior parsed syntax \nelements (if applicable). \nOutput of this process is the value of the syntax element. \nThis process is invoked for all syntax elements in the syntax tables in clause G.7.3 with descriptors equal to u(v), ue(v), \nme(v), se(v), te(v), ce(v), and ae(v). \nWhen the parsing process is invoked for the first request for a value of a syntax element in the slice data and \nentropy_coding_mode_flag is equal to 1, the following ordered steps apply: \n1.  The initialization process as specified in clause 9.3.1 is invoked, where a slice_type equal to EI is interpreted as \nI, a slice_type equal to EP is interpreted as P, and a slice_type equal to EB is interpreted as B. \n2.

By counting the number of leading bits that are equal to 0 and assigning this value \nto the variable leadingZeroBits, the variable codeNum is then derived as \ncodeNum = 2leadingZeroBits \u2212 1 + read_bits( leadingZeroBits ) \nwhere the value returned from read_bits( leadingZeroBits ) is interpreted as a binary representation of an unsigned integer \nwith most significant bit written first. \nWhen ref_layer_dq_id is greater than or equal to 0 and ( scan_idx_end \u2212 scan_idx_start ) is less than 15, codeNum is set \nequal to (codeNum \u2212 1). \nDepending on codeNum, the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  If codeNum is equal to \u22121, the following ordered steps are specified: \n1.

The total number of non-zero transform coefficient levels TotalCoeff( coeff_token ) and the number of trailing \none transform coefficient levels TrailingOnes( coeff_token ) are derived by parsing coeff_token as specified by \nthe following ordered steps: \na.  The  parsing  process  of  coeff_token  as  specified  in  clause 9.2.1  is  invoked  and  the  outputs  are \nTotalCoeff( coeff_token ), TrailingOnes( coeff_token ), and nC. \nNOTE \u2013 For macroblocks with base_mode_flag equal to 1, mb_type is inferred to be equal to Mb_Inferred and \nthe specifications in clause G.7.4.6 apply. \nb.

For all other syntax elements in clauses G.7.3.4.1 and G.7.3.6 the \ninitialization process of context variables as specified in clause 9.3.1 applies. \nFor each context variable, the two variables pStateIdx and valMPS are initialized. The two values assigned to pStateIdx \nand valMPS for the initialization are derived from SliceQP , which is derived in Equation 7-30. Given the two table entries \nY\n( m, n ), the initialization is specified by the following pseudo-code process: \npreCtxState = Clip3( 1, 126, ( ( m \uf02a Clip3( 0, 51, SliceQP  ) ) >> 4 ) + n ) \nY\nif( preCtxState  <=  63 )  { \n  pStateIdx = 63 \u2212 preCtxState \n  valMPS = 0 \n} else {      (G-363) \n  pStateIdx = preCtxState \u2212 64 \n  valMPS = 1 \n} \n \nIn Table G-11, the ctxIdx for which initialization is needed for each of the slice types EI, EP, and EB are listed. Also listed \nis the table number that includes the values of m and n needed for the initialization.

The set of access units consisting of the access unit associated with the scalability information SEI \nmessage and all succeeding access units in decoding order until, but excluding, the next access unit that does not contain \nany primary coded VCL NAL unit with IdrPicFlag equal to 0 (if present) or the end of the bitstream (otherwise) is referred \nto as the target access unit set. The scalability information SEI message applies to the target access unit set. \nThe scalability information SEI message provides information for subsets of the target access unit set. These subsets are \nreferred to as scalable layers. A scalable layer represents a set of NAL units, inside the target access unit set, that consists \nof VCL NAL units with the same values of dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id, as specified later in this clause, \nand associated non-VCL NAL units. When present in the target access unit set, the following NAL units are associated \nnon-VCL NAL units for a scalable layer: \n\u2013  sequence parameter set, subset sequence parameter set, and picture parameter set NAL units that are referenced in the \nVCL NAL units of the scalable layer (via the syntax element pic_parameter_set_id), \n\u2013  sequence parameter set extension NAL units that are associated with a sequence parameter set NAL unit referenced \nin the VCL NAL units of the scalable layer, \n\u2013  filler data NAL units that are associated with the same values of dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id as the \nVCL NAL units of the scalable layer, \n\u2013  SEI NAL units containing SEI messages, with payloadType not equal to 24, 28, or 29, that apply to subsets of the \nbitstream that contain one or more VCL NAL units of the scalable layer, \n\u2013  access unit delimiter, end of sequence, and end of stream NAL units that are present in access units that contain VCL \nNAL units of the scalable layer, \n\u2013  when dependency_id and quality_id are both equal to 0 in the VCL NAL units of a scalable layer, coded slice of an \nauxiliary coded picture without partitioning NAL units that are present in access units that contain VCL NAL units \nof the scalable layer. \nA scalable layer A is directly dependent on a scalable layer B when any primary coded VCL NAL unit of the scalable layer \nA references data of any VCL NAL unit of the scalable layer B through inter prediction or inter-layer prediction as specified \nin the decoding process in clause G.8, with the following exception: A scalable layer A (identified by layer_id[ a ]) is not \ndirectly  dependent  on  a  scalable  layer  B  (identified  by  layer_id[ b ])  when  dependency_id[ a ]  is  equal  to \ndependency_id[ b ], sub_pic_layer_flag[ a ] is equal to 1, and one of the following conditions is true: \n\u2013  sub_pic_layer_flag[ b ] is equal to 0, \n\u2013  sub_pic_layer_flag[ b ]  is  equal  to  1  and  (horizontal_offset[ a ]  is  not  equal  to  horizontal_offset[ b ], \nvertical_offset[ a ]  is  not  equal  to  vertical_offset[ b ],  region_width[ a ]  is  not  equal  to  region_width[ b ],  or \nregion_height[ a ] is not equal to region_height[ b ]). \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Sub-picture scalable layers with a particular value of dependency_id and a particular sub-picture area are only considered \nto depend on scalable layers with the same value of dependency_id when these scalable layers are associated with the same \nsub-picture area. \nA scalable layer A is indirectly dependent on a scalable layer B when the scalable layer A is not directly dependent on the \nscalable layer B but there exists a set of n (with n being greater than 0) scalable layers {C  .., C } with the following \n0, n\u22121\nproperties: The scalable layer A is directly dependent on the scalable layer C , each scalable layer C with i in the range of \n0 i\n0 to n \u2212 2, inclusive, is directly dependent on the scalable layer C , and the scalable layer C  is directly dependent on \ni+1 n\u22121\nthe scalable layer B. \n \n\nThe representation of a particular scalable layer is the set of NAL units that represents the set union of the particular \nscalable layer and all scalable layers on which the particular scalable layer directly or indirectly depends. The representation \nof a scalable layer is also referred to as scalable layer representation. In the following specification of this clause, the terms \nrepresentation of a scalable layer and scalable layer representation are also used for referring to the access unit set that can \nbe constructed from the NAL units of the scalable layer representation. A scalable layer representation can be decoded \nindependently of all NAL units that do not belong to the scalable layer representation. The decoding result of a scalable \nlayer representation is the set of decoded pictures that are obtained by decoding the access unit set of the scalable layer \nrepresentation. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The set of access units that is formed by the representation of a scalable layer with sub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] equal to 1 does \nnot conform to this Recommendation | International Standard, since the primary coded VCL NAL units with quality_id equal to 0 \nthat belong to such a scalable layer representation do not cover all macroblocks of the layer pictures with dependency_id equal to \ndependency_id[ i ] and quality_id equal to 0. For the following specification in this clause, the decoding result for the representation \nof a scalable layer with sub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] equal to 1 is the decoding result that would be obtained for the sub-picture area (as \nspecified later in this clause) by following the decoding process in clause G.8 but ignoring the constraint that the layer representations \nwith quality_id equal to 0 of primary coded pictures must cover all macroblocks of the corresponding layer pictures. \nEach scalable layer is associated with a unique layer identifier as specified later in this clause. The representation of a \nparticular scalable layer with a particular layer identifier layerId does not include any scalable layer with a layer identifier \ngreater than layerId, but it may include scalable layers with layer identifiers less than layerId. The scalable layers on which \na particular scalable layer depends may be indicated in the scalability information SEI message as specified later in this \nclause. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When all scalable layers for which scalability information is provided in the scalability information SEI message have \nsub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] equal to 0, the unique layer identifier values may be set equal to ( 128 * dependency_id + 8 * quality_id + \ntemporal_id ), with dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id being the corresponding syntax elements that are associated with \nthe VCL NAL units of a scalable layer. \ntemporal_id_nesting_flag indicates whether inter prediction is additionally restricted for the target access unit set. \nDepending on the value of temporal_id_nesting_flag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If temporal_id_nesting_flag is equal to 1, the scalability information SEI message indicates that the following \nconstraint is obeyed for all access units sets that can be derived from the target access unit set by invoking the \nsub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause G.8.8.1 with tIdTarget equal to any value in the range of 0 to \n7, inclusive, dIdTarget equal to any value in the range of 0 to 7, inclusive, and qIdTarget equal to any value in the \nrange of 0 to 15, inclusive, as the inputs: The values of the samples in the decoded pictures for each access unit auA \nwith temporal_id equal to tIdA and all following access units in decoding order are independent of an access unit auB \nwith temporal_id equal to tIdB and tIdB less than or equal to tIdA, when there exists an access unit auC with \ntemporal_id equal to tIdC and tIdC less than tIdB, that follows the access unit auB and precedes the access unit auA \nin decoding order. \n\u2013  Otherwise (temporal_id_nesting_flag is equal to 0), the scalability information SEI message indicates that the \nconstraint specified for temporal_id_nesting_flag equal to 1 may or may not be obeyed. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 The syntax element temporal_id_nesting_flag is used to indicate that temporal up-switching, i.e., switching from decoding \nof up to a particular temporal_id value tIdN to decoding of up to a temporal_id value tIdM greater than tIdN, is always possible \ninside the target access unit set. \npriority_layer_info_present_flag equal to 1 specifies that characteristic information for priority layers, as specified later \nin this clause, is present in the scalability information SEI message and that priority layer information SEI messages \nassociating an alternative value for priority_id with each layer representation of the primary coded pictures in the target \naccess unit set are present. priority_layer_info_present_flag equal to 0 specifies that characteristic information for priority \nlayers is not present in the scalability information SEI message. \npriority_id_setting_flag equal to 1 specifies that syntax elements priority_id_setting_uri[ i ] are present in the scalability \ninformation SEI message and that the description of the method used to calculate the priority_id values is provided by the \nspecified  universal  resource  identifier  (URI).  priority_id_setting_flag  equal  to  0  specifies  that  syntax  elements \npriority_id_setting_uri[ i ] are not present in the scalability information SEI message. \nnum_layers_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of scalable layers for which information is provided in the scalability \ninformation SEI message. The value of num_layers_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 2047, inclusive. \nlayer_id[ i ] specifies the layer identifier of the i-th scalable layer specified in the scalability information SEI message. \nlayer_id[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 2047, inclusive. \nFor the following specification inside this clause, the scalable layer with layer identifier equal to the current value of \nlayer_id[ i ] is referred to as the current scalable layer, and the representation of the current scalable layer is referred to as \nthe current scalable layer representation. \n \n\npriority_id[ i ] indicates an upper bound for the priority_id values of the current scalable layer representation. All primary \ncoded VCL NAL units of the current scalable layer representation shall have a value of priority_id that is less than or equal \nto priority_id[ i ]. \ndiscardable_flag[ i ] equal to 1 indicates that all primary coded VCL NAL units of the current scalable layer have \ndiscardable_flag equal to 1. discardable_flag[ i ] equal to 0 indicates that the current scalable layer may contain one or \nmore primary coded VCL NAL units with discardable_flag equal to 0. \ndependency_id[ i ], quality_id[ i ], and temporal_id[ i ] are equal to the values of dependency_id, quality_id, and \ntemporal_id, respectively, of the VCL NAL units of the current scalable layer. All VCL NAL units of a scalable layer have \nthe same values of dependency_id, quality_id, and temporal_id. \nWhen the target access unit set does not contain any primary coded VCL NAL unit with particular values of dependency_id, \nquality_id, and temporal_id, the scalability information SEI message shall not contain information for a scalable layer with \ndependency_id[ i ], quality_id[ i ], and temporal_id[ i ] equal to the particular values of dependency_id, quality_id, and \ntemporal_id, respectively. \nNOTE 5 \u2013 When an application removes NAL units from a scalable bitstream, e.g. in order to adapt the bitstream to a transmission \nchannel or the capabilities of a receiving device, and keeps the present scalability information SEI messages, it might need to modify \nthe content of the scalability information SEI messages in order to obtain a bitstream conforming to this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard. \nsub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] specifies whether the current scalable layer represents a sub-picture scalable layer as specified \nsubsequently. Depending on sub_pic_layer_flag[ i ], the following applies: \n\u2013  If sub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] is equal to 0, the current scalable layer does not represent a sub-picture scalable layer. The \nVCL NAL units of the current scalable layer are all VCL NAL units of the target access unit set that have \ndependency_id,  quality_id,  and  temporal_id  equal  to  dependency_id[ i ],  quality_id[ i ],  and  temporal_id[ i ], \nrespectively. \n\u2013  Otherwise (sub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] is equal to 1), the current scalable layer represents a sub-picture scalable layer and \nis associated with a sub-picture area as specified in the following: \n(a)  The sub-picture area is a rectangular area of slice group map units inside the layer frames with dependency_id \nequal to dependency_id[ i ] and represents a proper subset of the area of the layer frames with dependency_id \nequal to dependency_id[ i ]. The sub-picture area associated with a sub-picture scalable layer does not change \ninside the target access unit set. The sub-picture area is specified by the syntax elements horizontal_offset[ i ], \nvertical_offset[ i ], region_width[ i ], and region_height[ i ] as specified later in this clause. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 The sub-picture area for a sub-picture scalable layer may additionally be indicated by the presence of sub-\npicture scalable layer SEI messages with layer_id equal to value of layer_id[ i ] for the current scalable layer. \n(b)  When a VCL NAL unit of the target access unit set has dependency_id equal to dependency_id[ i ] and contains \nany macroblock that resides inside the sub-picture area,

In the \nfollowing, a temporal segment tSeg is any set of two or more consecutive access units, in decoding order, of the current \nscalable layer representation, fTotal( tSeg ) is the number of frames, complementary field pairs, and non-paired fields in \nthe temporal segment tSeg, t ( tSeg ) is the removal time (in seconds) of the first access unit (in decoding order) of the \n1\ntemporal segment tSeg, t ( tSeg ) is the removal time (in seconds) of the last access unit (in decoding order) of the temporal \n2\nsegment tSeg, and avgFR( tSeg ) is the average frame rate in the temporal segment tSeg, which is given by: \navgFR( tSeg)  = =  Round( fTotal( tSeg ) * 256 \u00f7 ( t ( tSeg ) \u2212 t ( tSeg ) ) )  (G-374) \n2 1\nIf the current scalable layer representation does only contain one access unit or the value of avgFR( tSeg ) is constant over \nall temporal segments of the scalable layer representation, the frame rate is constant; otherwise, the frame rate is not \nconstant. constant_frm_rate_idc[ i ] equal to 0 indicates that the frame rate of the current scalable layer representation is \nnot constant. constant_frm_rate_idc[ i ] equal to 1 indicates that the frame rate of the current scalable layer representation \nis constant. constant_frm_rate_idc[ i ] equal to  2 indicates that the frame rate of the current scalable layer representation \nmay or may not be constant.

When rewriting_info_flag[ i ][ j ] is equal to 1, it is asserted that the information \nsignalled  by  the  syntax  elements  rewriting_profile_level_idc[ i ][ j ],  rewriting_avg_bitrate[ i ][ j ],  and \nrewriting_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ]  is  correct,  though,  when  conversion_type_idc[ i ]  is  equal  to 0  or  the  value  of \nentropy_coding_mode_flag is modified, the method for constructing the alternative set of access units is unspecified. \nrewriting_profile_level_idc[ i ][ j ] indicates the conformance point of the alternative set of access units for the current \nscalable layer representation after conversion. rewriting_profile_level_idc[ i ] is the exact copy of the three bytes consist \nof profile_idc, constraint_set0_flag, constraint_set1_flag, constraint_set2_flag, constraint_set3_flag, constraint_set4_flag, \nconstraint_set5_flag, reserved_zero_2bits, and level_idc, as if these syntax elements were used to specify the profile and \nlevel conformance of the alternative set of access units obtained by converting the scalable layer representation. \nrewriting_avg_bitrate[ i ][ j ] indicates the average bit rate of the alternative set of access units obtained by converting \nthe representation of the current scalable layer. The average bit rate of the alternative set of access units in bits per second \nis given by BitRateBPS( rewriting_avg_bitrate[ i ][ j ] ) with the function BitRateBPS( ) being specified in Equation G-\n370. The average bit rate is derived according to the access unit removal time specified in Annex C of the Recommendation \n| International Standard. \n \n\nrewriting_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ] indicates an upper bound for the bit rate of the alternative set of access units obtained by \nconverting the representation of the current scalable layer, in any one-second time window of access unit removal time as \nspecified in Annex C. The upper bound for the bit rate of the alternative set of access units in bits per second is given by \nBitRateBPS( rewriting_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ] ) with the function BitRateBPS( ) being specified in Equation G-370. \nFor the following specification, the terms priority layer, dependency layer, and priority layer representation are defined as \nfollows. A priority layer consists of the set of primary coded VCL NAL units, inside the target access unit set, that are \nassociated with a particular value of dependency_id and a value of alt_priority_id[ i ], as specified in clause G.13.2.4, that \nis less than or equal to a particular priority identifier pId and the set of associated non-VCL NAL units. A priority layer is \nassociated with a particular value of dependency_id and a particular priority layer identifier pId. When present in the target \naccess unit, the following NAL units are associated non-VCL NAL units for a priority layer: \n\u2013  sequence parameter set, subset sequence parameter set, and picture parameter set NAL units that are referenced in the \nVCL NAL units of the priority layer (via the syntax element pic_parameter_set_id), \n\u2013  sequence parameter set extension NAL units that are associated with a sequence parameter set NAL unit referenced \nin the VCL NAL units of the priority layer, \n\u2013  filler data NAL units that belong to an access unit containing VCL NAL units of the priority layer and are associated \nwith the same values of dependency_id and quality_id as the VCL NAL units of the priority layer in the same access \nunit, \n\u2013  SEI NAL units containing SEI messages, with payloadType not equal to 24, 28, or 29, that apply to subsets of the \nbitstream that contain one or more VCL NAL units of the priority layer, \n\u2013  access unit delimiter, end of sequence, and end of stream NAL units that are present in access units that contain VCL \nNAL units of the priority layer. \nThe set of NAL units that represents the set union of all priority layers that are associated with the same value of \ndependency_id  is  referred  to  as  dependency  layer.  A  dependency  layer  is  associated  with  a  particular  value  of \ndependency_id. \nA priority layer A is directly dependent on a priority layer B when any VCL NAL unit of the priority layer A references \ndata of any VCL NAL unit of the priority layer B through inter prediction or inter-layer prediction as specified in the \ndecoding process in clause G.8. A priority layer A is indirectly dependent on a priority layer B when the priority layer A \nis not directly dependent on the priority layer B but there exists a set of n (with n being greater than 0) priority layers \n{C  .., C } with the following properties: The priority layer A is directly dependent on the priority layer C , each priority \n0, n\u22121 0\nlayer C with i in the range of 0 to n \u2212 2, inclusive, is directly dependent on the priority layer C , and the priority layer \ni i+1\nC  is directly dependent on the priority layer B. \nn\u22121\nThe representation of a particular priority layer is the set of NAL units that represents the set union of the particular priority \nlayer and all priority layers on which the particular priority layer directly or indirectly depends. The representation of a \npriority layer is also referred to as priority layer representation. In the following specification of this clause, the terms \nrepresentation of a priority layer and priority layer representation are also used for referring to the access unit set that can \nbe constructed from the NAL units of the priority layer representation. A priority layer representation can be decoded \nindependently of all NAL units that do not belong to the priority layer representation. \npr_num_dIds_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of dependency layers for which the priority layer characteristic \ninformation as specified by the following syntax elements is present in the scalability information SEI message. The value \nof pr_num_dIds_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 7, inclusive. \npr_dependency_id[ i ] specifies the value of dependency_id of the dependency layer for which the priority layer \ncharacteristic information is signalled by the following syntax elements. When i is greater than 0, the value of \npr_dependency_id[ i ] shall not be equal to any of the values of pr_dependency_id[ j ] with j = 0..(i \u2212 1). \npr_num_minus1[ i ] plus 1 specifies the number of priority layers with dependency_id equal to pr_dependency_id[ i ] for \nwhich priority layer characteristic information as specified by the following syntax elements is present in the scalability \ninformation SEI message. The value of pr_num_minus1[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 63, inclusive. \npr_id[ i ][ j ] specifies the priority identifier pId for a priority layer with dependency_id equal to pr_dependency_id[ i ]. \nThe value of pr_id[ i ][ j ] shall be in the range of 0 to 63, inclusive. The target access unit set shall contain one or more \nprimary  coded  VCL  NAL  units  that  are  associated  with  dependency_id  equal  to  pr_dependency_id[ i ]  and \nalt_priority_id[ i ] equal to pr_id[ i ][ j ], where the value of alt_priority_id[ i ] that is associated with a primary coded VCL \nNAL unit is specified in clause G.13.2.4. When j is greater than 0, the value of pr_id[ i ][ j ] shall not be equal to any of \nthe values of pr_id[ i ][ k ] with k = 0..(j \u2212 1). \nFor the following specification inside the clause, the priority layer with dependency_id equal to the current value of \npr_dependency_id[ i ] and the priority layer identifier pId equal to the current value of pr_id[ i ][ j ] is referred to as the \n \n\ncurrent priority layer and the representation of the current priority layer is referred to as the current priority layer \nrepresentation. \npr_profile_level_idc[ i ][ j ]  indicates  the  conformance  point  of  the  current  priority  layer  representation. \npr_profile_level_idc[ i ]  is  the  exact  copy  of  the  three  bytes  consisting  of  profile_idc,  constraint_set0_flag, \nconstraint_set1_flag,  constraint_set2_flag,  constraint_set3_flag,  constraint_set4_flag,  constraint_set5_flag, \nreserved_zero_2bits, and level_idc, as if these syntax elements were used to specify the profile and level conformance of \nthe current priority layer representation. \npr_avg_bitrate[ i ][ j ] indicates the average bit rate of the current priority layer representation. The average bit rate of the \ncurrent priority layer representation in bits per second is given by BitRateBPS( pr_avg_bitrate[ i ][ j ] ) with the function \nBitRateBPS( ) being specified in Equation G-370. The average bit rate is derived according to the access unit removal time \nspecified in Annex C of this Recommendation | International Standard. In the following, bTotal is the number of bits in all \nNAL units of the current priority layer representation, t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the access unit associated with \n1\nthe scalability information SEI message, and t  is the removal time (in seconds) of the last access unit (in decoding order) \n2\nof the target access unit set. \nWith x specifying the value of pr_avg_bitrate[ i ], the following applies: \n\u2013  If t  is not equal to t , the condition specified in Equation G-371 shall be fulfilled. \n1 2\n\u2013  Otherwise (t  is equal to t ), the condition specified in Equation G-372 shall be fulfilled. \n1 2\npr_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ] indicates an upper bound for the bit rate of the current priority layer representation in any \none-second time window of access unit removal time as specified in Annex C. The upper bound for the bit rate of the \ncurrent priority layer representation in bits per second is given by BitRateBPS( pr_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ] ) with the function \nBitRateBPS( ) being specified in Equation G-370. The bit rate values are derived according to the access unit removal time \nspecified in Annex C of this Recommendation | International Standard. In the following, t  is any point in time (in seconds), \n1\nt  is set equal to t  + 1, and bTotal is the number of bits in all NAL units of the current priority layer representation that \n2 1\nbelong to access units with a removal time greater than or equal to t  and less than t . With x specifying the value of \n1 2\npr_max_bitrate[ i ][ j ], the condition specified in Equation G-373 shall be obeyed. \npriority_id_setting_uri[ PriorityIdSettingUriIdx ]  is  the  PriorityIdSettingUriIdx-th  byte  of  a  null-terminated  string \nencoded in UTF-8 characters, specifying the universal resource identifier (URI) of the description of the method used to \ncalculate the priority_id values in the NAL unit headers for the target access unit set. \nG.13.2.2 Sub-picture scalable layer SEI message semantics \nThe sub-picture scalable SEI message provides a mechanism for associating a slice group set indicated in a motion-\nconstrained slice group set SEI message with a sub-picture scalable layer. \nIn the following specification of this clause, the terms scalable layer, sub-picture scalable layer, and primary coded VCL \nNAL unit are used as specified in clause G.13.2.1. \nA sub-picture scalable layer SEI message shall not be succeeded, in decoding order, by a scalability information SEI \nmessage inside the same access unit. \nWhen a sub-picture scalable SEI message is present, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message is included in a scalable nesting SEI message, a motion-constrained slice \ngroup set SEI message, which is also referred to as the associated motion-constrained slice group set SEI message, \nshall be present in the same scalable nesting SEI message and it shall immediately precede the sub-picture scalable \nlayer SEI message in decoding order. The scalable nesting SEI message that contains the sub-picture scalable layer \nSEI message shall contain num_layer_representations_minus1 equal to 0 and sei_quality_id[ 0 ] equal to 0. The \nvariable depId is set equal to the value of sei_dependency_id[ 0 ] that is present in the scalable nesting SEI message \ncontaining the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message is not included in a scalable nesting SEI message), the \nsub-picture scalable layer SEI message shall be the first SEI payload in an SEI NAL unit and the NAL unit \nimmediately preceding the SEI NAL unit containing the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message shall be an SEI NAL \nunit that contains a motion-constrained slice group set SEI message, which is also referred to as associated motion-\nconstrained slice group set SEI message, as last SEI payload. The variable depId is set equal to 0. \nThe slice group set identified by the associated motion-constrained slice group set SEI message is referred to as the \nassociated slice group set of the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message. \nThe access unit associated with the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message shall not contain any primary coded VCL NAL \nunit that has dependency_id equal to depId and IdrPicFlag equal to 0.

The sub-picture scalable layer SEI message \napplies to the target access unit set. \nNOTE \u2013 The set of primary coded pictures in the target access unit set for a sub-picture scalable layer SEI message is identical to \nthe target picture set for the associated motion-constrained slice group set SEI message. \nlayer_id indicates, when the access unit containing the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message belongs to the target access \nunit set of a scalability information SEI message, the layer identifier of the sub-picture scalable layer to which the coded \nslice NAL units in the associated slice group set belong. The value of layer_id shall be in the range of 0 to 2047, inclusive. \nThe access unit containing the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message may or may not belong to the target access unit set \nof a scalability information SEI message. When the access unit containing the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message \nbelongs to the target access unit set of a scalability information SEI message, the corresponding scalability information \nSEI message may or may not contain information for a scalable layer i with layer identifier layer_id[ i ] equal to layer_id. \nWhen the access unit containing the sub-picture scalable layer SEI message belongs to the target access unit set of a \nscalability information SEI message and the corresponding scalability information SEI message contains information for \na scalable layer i with layer identifier layer_id[ i ] equal to layer_id, which is referred to as the current scalable layer in the \nfollowing, the following applies. The information for the current scalable layer in the scalability SEI shall contain \nsub_pic_layer_flag[ i ] equal to 1.

The instances of entry_dependency_id[ i ] shall appear in increasing order of their \nvalues. \nThe dependency representation of the primary coded picture with dependency_id equal to entry_dependency_id[ i ] is \nreferred to as the target dependency representation. \nThe target dependency representation may or may not be present in the access unit. \nnum_non_required_layer_reps_minus1[ i ] plus 1 specifies the number of non-required layer representations for the \ntarget  dependency  representation  that  are  indicated  in  the  SEI  message.

A non-required layer representation for the target dependency \nrepresentation is not required for decoding the target dependency representation and any dependency representation with \ndependency_id equal to entry_dependency_id[ i ] of primary coded pictures that follow the current primary picture in \ndecoding order. \nWhen  DependencyIdMax  is  equal  to  entry_dependency_id[ i ],  the  VCL  NAL  units  of  the  non-required  layer \nrepresentations shall not be referenced through inter or inter-layer prediction in the decoding process as specified in \nclause G.8. \nNOTE \u2013 In addition to the i-th non-required layer representation for the target dependency representation, those layer representations \nthat  have  dependency_id  equal  to  non_required_layer_rep_dependency_id[ i ][ j ]  and  quality_id  greater  than \nnon_required_layer_rep_quality_id[ i ][ j ] are also non-required layer representations for the target dependency representation. \nThe i-th non-required layer representation may or may not be present in the access unit. \n \n\nG.13.2.4 Priority layer information SEI message semantics \nThe priority layer information SEI message provides a mechanism for signalling alternative priority_id values for VCL \nNAL units of the primary coded picture. The alternative values for priority_id indicate priority layers. \nThe priority layer information SEI message shall not be included in a scalable nesting SEI message. \npr_dependency_id specifies the value of dependency_id for the VCL NAL units for which alternative values for \npriority_id are indicated. \nnum_priority_ids specifies the number of layer representations with dependency_id equal to pr_dependency_id for which \nalternative values of priority_id are indicated. \nalt_priority_id[ i ] specifies the alternative value for priority_id for the VCL NAL units of the primary coded picture that \nhave dependency_id equal to pr_dependency_id and quality_id equal to i. \nThe layer representation of the primary coded picture with dependency_id equal to pr_dependency_id and quality_id equal \nto i may or may not be present in the access unit. \nG.13.2.5 Layers not present SEI message semantics \nThe layers not present SEI message provides a mechanism for signalling that NAL units of particular scalable layers \nindicated by the preceding scalability information SEI message are not present in a particular set of access units. \nIn the following specification of this clause, the terms scalable layer and primary coded VCL NAL unit are used as specified \nin clause G.13.2.1. \nA layers not present SEI message shall not be included in a scalable nesting SEI message. \nA layers not present SEI message shall not be present in an access unit that does not belong to the target access unit set of \nany scalability information SEI message. A layers not present SEI message shall not be succeeded, in decoding order, by \na scalability information SEI message inside the same access unit. The set of access units consisting of the access unit \nassociated with the layers not present SEI message and all succeeding access units in decoding order until, but excluding, \nthe next access unit that contains a layers not present SEI message or that does not contain any primary coded VCL NAL \nunits with IdrPicFlag equal to 0 (if present), or the end of the bitstream (otherwise) is referred to as the target access unit \nset. The layers not present SEI message applies to the target access unit set. \nA layers not present SEI message refers to the most recent scalability information SEI message in decoding order. Each \nscalable layer that is referred to in this clause is a scalable layer indicated in the most recent scalability information SEI \nmessage in decoding order. Each layer identifier for a scalable layer that is referred to in this clause is a layer identifier for \na scalable layer indicated in the most recent scalability information SEI message in decoding order. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Layers not present SEI messages do not have a cumulative effect. \nnum_layers specifies the number of syntax elements layer_id[ i ] that are present in the layers not present SEI message. \nThe value of num_layers shall be in the range of 0 to 2047, inclusive. \nlayer_id[ i ] indicates the layer identifier of a scalable layer for which no VCL NAL units are present in the target access \nunit set. The value of layer_id[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 2047, inclusive.

When i is greater than 0, \nthe value of layer_id[ i ] shall not be equal to any of the values of layer_id[ j ] with j = 0..(i \u2212 1). \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When an application removes NAL units from a scalable bitstream, e.g. in order to adapt the bitstream to a transmission \nchannel or the capabilities of a receiving device, and keeps the present layers not present SEI messages, it might need to modify the \ncontent of some of the layers not present SEI messages and remove some other layers not present SEI messages in order to obtain a \nbitstream conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard. \nG.13.2.6 Layer dependency change SEI message semantics \nThe layer dependency change SEI message provides a mechanism for signalling that the interdependencies between \nparticular scalable layers indicated by the preceding scalability information SEI message are changed for a particular set \nof access units. \nIn the following specification of this clause, the terms scalable layer, representation of a scalable layer, scalable layer \nrepresentation, and primary coded VCL NAL unit are used as specified in clause G.13.2.1. \nA layer dependency change SEI message shall not be included in a scalable nesting SEI message. \nA layer dependency change SEI message shall not be present in an access unit that does not belong to the target access unit \nset of any scalability information SEI message. A layer dependency change SEI message shall not be succeeded, in \ndecoding order, by a scalability information SEI message or a layers not present SEI message inside the same access unit. \nThe set of access units consisting of the access unit associated with the layer dependency change SEI message and all \n \n\nsucceeding access units in decoding order until, but excluding, the next access unit that contains a layer dependency change \nSEI message or a layers not present SEI message or that does not contain any primary coded VCL NAL units with \nIdrPicFlag equal to 0 (if present), or the end of the bitstream (otherwise) is referred to as the target access unit set.

For a scalable layer with a layer \nidentifier equal to any value of layer_id[ i ] present in the layer dependency change SEI message, the layer dependency \nrelationship is changed for the target access unit set relative to the layer dependency relationship specified by the most \nrecent scalability information SEI message in decoding order. For a scalable layer with a layer identifier not equal to any \nvalue of layer_id[ i ] present in the layer dependency change SEI message, the layer dependency relationship remains the \nsame as the one specified in the most recent scalability information SEI message in decoding order. \nWhen, according to the layer dependency information indicated in the most recent scalability information SEI message in \ndecoding order, a scalable layer A does not directly or indirectly depend on another scalable layer B, the layer dependency \nchange SEI message shall not specify that the scalable layer A directly or indirectly depends on the scalable layer B. \nWhen a scalable layer is considered to directly or indirectly depend on another scalable layer is specified in clause G.13.2.1, \nwith the target access unit set being the target access unit set for the layer dependency change SEI message. \nnum_layers_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of scalable layers for which a layer dependency information change \nrelative to the most recent scalability information SEI message, in decoding order, is indicated in the layer dependency \nchange SEI message.

Depending on temporal_id of the current access unit, the following applies: \n\u2013  If  temporal_id  of  the  current  access  unit  is  equal  to 0,  tl0_dep_rep_idx  shall  be  equal  to \n( prevTL0DepRepIdx + 1 ) % 256. \n\u2013  Otherwise (temporal_id of the current access unit is greater than 0), tl0_dep_rep_idx shall be equal to \nprevTL0DepRepIdx. \nWhen the temporal level zero dependency representation index SEI message is associated with a particular dependency \nrepresentation depRepA that has dependency_id equal dIdA and IdrPicFlag equal to 0, a temporal level zero dependency \nrepresentation index SEI message shall also be associated with the previous dependency representation dIdB in decoding \norder that has dependency_id equal to dIdA and IdrPicFlag  equal to 1 and all dependency representations with \ndependency_id equal to dIdA and temporal_id equal to 0 that follow the dependency representation dIdB and precede the \ndependency representation dIdA in decoding order. \nNOTE \u2013 For the tl0_dep_rep_idx mechanism to be effectively used, transport mechanisms should ensure that the information is \npresent in every packet that carries data for the particular values of dependency_id. \neffective_idr_pic_id indicates the latest value of idr_pic_id in decoding order present in this access unit or any preceding \naccess unit for dependency representations indicated by sei_dependency_id[ i ]. \nFor each value of dId in the set setOfDId, the following applies: \n \n\n\u2013  If the dependency representation with dependency_id equal to dId contains a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 5 \nor a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 20 and idr_flag equal to 1, effective_idr_pic_id shall be equal to idr_pic_id \nof the dependency representation with dependency_id equal to dId. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the dependency representation with dependency_id equal to dId does not contain a NAL unit with \nnal_unit_type equal to 5 or a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 20 and idr_flag equal to 1), effective_idr_pic_id \nshall be equal to idr_pic_id of the previous dependency representation in decoding order with dependency_id equal \nto dId that contains a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 5 or a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 20 and \nidr_flag equal to 1. \nG.13.2.12  Temporal level switching point SEI message semantics \nThe temporal level switching point SEI message provides a mechanism for identifying temporal level switching points. If \na dependency representation is associated with a temporal level switching point SEI message, then it is a temporal level \nswitching point as specified subsequently and constrained by delta_frame_num. Otherwise, the dependency representation \nmay or may not be a temporal level switching point. \nAll dependency representations that are referred to in  the  following specification  of this  clause are dependency \nrepresentations of primary coded pictures. \nIn the following, let tId be the value of temporal_id of the access unit that is associated with the temporal level switching \npoint SEI message. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Let dId be the value of dependency_id that a bitstream adaptation process has used to generate a bitstream subset \nsubBitstreamA that contains dependency representations with dependency_id less than or equal to dId and temporal_id less than tId \nof an input bitstream (that is conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard) until the current access unit, exclusive. \nThe bitstream adaptation process can infer from a temporal level switching point SEI message whether or not the bitstream subset \ncontaining subBitstreamA and the dependency representations with dependency_id less than or equal to dId and temporal_id less \nthan  or  equal  to  tId  of  the  input  bitstream  starting  from  the  current  access  unit,  inclusive,  is  conforming  to  this \nRecommendation | International Standard. \nThe temporal level switching point SEI message shall not be present in access units with temporal_id equal to 0. \nThe temporal level switching point SEI message shall be included in a scalable nesting SEI message. For the scalable \nnesting SEI message that contains the temporal level switching point SEI message, all_layer_representations_in_au_flag \nshall be equal to 1 or the value of sei_quality_id[ i ] shall be equal to 0 for all values of i in the range of 0 to \nnum_layer_representations_minus1, inclusive. \nThe following semantics apply independently to each value of sei_dependency_id[ i ] indicated by the scalable nesting SEI \nmessage containing the temporal level switching point SEI message. The current access unit, i.e., the access unit associated \nwith the temporal level switching point SEI message, may or may not contain a dependency representation with \ndependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ]. When the current access unit contains a dependency representation with \ndependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ], the following semantics apply. \nThe following semantics are specified in a way that they apply to a bitstream conforming to this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard for which DependencyIdMax for the current access unit is equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ]. \nLet the switch-to dependency representation be the dependency representation in the current access unit that has \ndependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ] and let maxFrameNum be the value of MaxFrameNum for the SVC \nsequence parameter set that is the active SVC sequence parameter set for the current access unit (with DependencyIdMax \nequal to sei_dependency_id[ i ]). \ndelta_frame_num indicates the difference between the frame_num values of the switch-to dependency representation and \nthe dependency representation with dependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ] in the required access unit, as specified \nsubsequently. The value of delta_frame_num shall be in the range of  1 \u2212 maxFrameNum to maxFrameNum \u2212 1, inclusive. \nLet currFrameNum be the frame_num value of the switch-to dependency representation. The variable requiredFrameNum \nis set equal to currFrameNum \u2212 delta_frame_num. Let lastIdrAU be the most recent access unit in decoding order that \ncontains a dependency representation with dependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ] and IdrPicFlag equal to 1. The \nbitstream shall contain an access unit that succeeds the access unit lastIdrAU and precedes the current access unit in \ndecoding order and contains a dependency representation with frame_num equal to requiredFrameNum and dependency_id \nequal to sei_dependency_id[ i ]. The most recent access unit in decoding order that contains a dependency representation \nwith frame_num equal to requiredFrameNum and dependency_id equal to sei_dependency_id[ i ] is referred to as the \nrequired access unit. The required access unit shall have a value of temporal_id that is equal to tId \u2212 1. \nThe current access unit and all subsequent access units in decoding order for which temporal_id is less than or equal to tId \nshall not reference any of the following access units through inter prediction in the decoding process specified in \nclause G.8: \n\u2013  access units that precede the required access unit in decoding order and have temporal_id equal to tId \u2212 1, \n \n\n\u2013  access units that precede the current access unit in decoding order and have temporal_id equal to tId. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The set of access units consisting of the current access unit and all access units with temporal_id less than or equal to tId \nthat follow the current access unit in decoding order can be decoded when all of the following access units, which precede the current \naccess unit in decoding order, have been decoded: all access units required for decoding the required access unit (i.e., all access units \nthat are directly or indirectly referenced through inter prediction in the decoding process for the required access unit), the required \naccess unit, and all access units with temporal_id less than tId that succeed the required access unit and precede the current access \nunit in decoding order. \nG.14  Video usability information \nThe specifications in Annex E apply with substituting SVC sequence parameter set for sequence parameter set. The VUI \nparameters and the constraints specified in Annex E apply to coded video sequences for which the SVC sequence parameter \nset becomes the active SVC sequence parameter set. \nAdditionally, the following applies. \nG.14.1  SVC VUI parameters extension syntax \n \nsvc_vui_parameters_extension( ) {  C  Descriptor \n  vui_ext_num_entries_minus1  0  ue(v) \n  for( i = 0; i <= vui_ext_num_entries_minus1; i++ ) {     \n    vui_ext_dependency_id[ i ]  0  u(3) \n    vui_ext_quality_id[ i ]  0  u(4) \n    vui_ext_temporal_id[ i ]  0  u(3) \n    vui_ext_timing_info_present_flag[ i ]  0  u(1) \n    if( vui_ext_timing_info_present_flag[ i ] ) {     \n      vui_ext_num_units_in_tick[ i ]  0  u(32) \n      vui_ext_time_scale[ i ]  0  u(32) \n      vui_ext_fixed_frame_rate_flag[ i ]  0  u(1) \n    }     \n    vui_ext_nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ]  0  u(1) \n    if( vui_ext_nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ] )     \n      hrd_parameters( )  0   \n    vui_ext_vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ]  0  u(1) \n    if( vui_ext_vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ] )     \n      hrd_parameters( )  0   \n    if( vui_ext_nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ]  | |       \n      vui_ext_vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag[ i ] ) \n      vui_ext_low_delay_hrd_flag[ i ]  0  u(1) \n    vui_ext_pic_struct_present_flag[ i ]   0  u(1) \n  }     \n}     \nG.14.2  SVC VUI parameters extension semantics \nThe SVC VUI parameters extension specifies timing information, HRD parameter sets, and the presence of picture \nstructure information for subsets of coded video sequences (including the complete coded video sequences) conforming \none or more of the profiles specified in Annex G. In Annex C it is specified which of the HRD parameter sets specified in \nthe SVC VUI parameters extension are used for conformance checking. \nvui_ext_num_entries_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of information entries that are present in the SVC VUI \nparameters extension syntax structure. The value of vui_ext_num_entries_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, \ninclusive. Each information entry is associated with particular values of temporal_id, dependency_id, and quality_id and \nmay indicate timing information, NAL HRD parameters, VCL HRD parameters, and the presence of picture structure \ninformation for a particular subset of coded video sequences as specified in the following. \n \n\nvui_ext_dependency_id[ i ] and vui_ext_quality_id[ i ] indicate the maximum value of DQId for the i-th subset of coded \nvideo  sequences.  The  maximum  value  of  DQId  for  the  i-th  subset  of  coded  video  sequences  is  derived  by \nvui_ext_dependency_id[ i ] + ( vui_ext_quality_id[ i ] << 4 ). \nvui_ext_temporal_id[ i ] indicates the maximum value of temporal_id for the i-th subset of coded video sequences. \nThe SVC VUI parameters extension syntax structure shall not contain two or more information entries with identical values \nof vui_ext_dependency_id[ i ], vui_ext_quality_id[ i ], and vui_ext_temporal_id[ i ]. \nThe following syntax elements apply to the coded video sequences that are obtained by the invoking the sub-bitstream \nextraction process as specified in clause G.8.8.1 with tIdTarget equal to vui_ext_temporal_id[ i ], dIdTarget equal to \nvui_ext_dependency_id[ i ], and qIdTarget equal to vui_ext_quality_id[ i ] as the inputs and the i-th subset of coded video \nsequences as the output. \nvui_ext_timing_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 1 specifies that vui_ext_num_units_in_tick[ i ], vui_ext_time_scale[ i ], \nand vui_ext_fixed_frame_rate_flag[ i ] for the i-th subset of coded video sequences are present in the SVC VUI parameters \nextension.  vui_ext_timing_info_present_flag[ i ]  equal  to 0  specifies  that  vui_ext_num_units_in_tick[ i ], \nvui_ext_time_scale[ i ], and vui_ext_fixed_frame_rate_flag[ i ] for the i-th subset of coded video sequences are not present \nin the SVC VUI parameters extension. \nThe following syntax elements for the i-th subset of coded video sequences are specified using references to Annex E.

These definitions \nare either not present in clause 3 or replace definitions in clause 3. \nH.3.1  access unit: A set of NAL units that are consecutive in decoding order and contain exactly one primary coded \npicture consisting of one or more view components. In addition to the primary coded picture, an access unit may \nalso contain one or more redundant coded pictures, one auxiliary coded picture, or other NAL units not containing \nslices or slice data partitions of a coded picture. The decoding of an access unit always results in one decoded \npicture consisting of one or more decoded view components. \nH.3.2  anchor access unit: An access unit in which the primary coded picture is an anchor picture. \nH.3.3  anchor picture: A coded picture in which all slices may reference only slices within the same access unit, i.e., \ninter-view prediction may be used, but no inter prediction is used, and all following coded pictures in output order \ndo not use inter prediction from any picture prior to the coded picture in decoding order. The value of \nanchor_pic_flag is equal to 1 for all the prefix NAL units (when present) and all the slice extension NAL units \nthat are contained in an anchor picture. \nH.3.4  anchor view component: A view component in an anchor picture.

A reference picture contains samples \nthat may be used for inter prediction in the decoding process of subsequent view components in decoding order. \nA reference picture may be an inter-view reference component, in which case the samples contained in the \nreference picture may also be used for inter-view prediction in the decoding process of subsequent view \n \n\ncomponents in decoding order. \nH.3.34  reference picture list: A list of reference pictures and inter-view only reference components that are used for \ninter prediction or inter-view prediction of a P or B slice. For the decoding process of a P slice, there is one \nreference picture list.

All inter prediction or inter-view prediction used for P slices uses reference picture list 0. Reference picture \nlist 0 is one of two reference picture lists used for inter prediction or inter-view prediction for a B slice, with the \nother being reference picture list 1. \nH.3.36  reference picture list 1: A reference picture list used for inter prediction or inter-view prediction of a B slice. \nReference picture list 1 is one of two reference picture lists used for inter prediction or inter-view prediction for \na B slice, with the other being reference picture list 0. \nH.3.37  reference picture marking: Specifies, in the bitstream, how the decoded view components are marked for inter \nprediction or inter-view prediction. \nH.3.38  reference processing unit: A functional unit that processes an inter-view prediction reference before the inter-\nview prediction reference is used for inter-view prediction in the decoding process of subsequent view components \nin decoding order. \nH.3.39  reference view index: An index into a list of anchor view components or a list of non-anchor view components \nthat are specified in the sequence parameter set MVC extension syntax structure and can be used for inter-view \nprediction as list 0 prediction or list 1 prediction. \nH.3.40  right view: The right part of a picture coded in a frame-packed manner with the side-by-side frame packing \narrangement type or the bottom part of a picture coded in a frame-packed manner with the top-bottom frame \npacking arrangement type. \nH.3.41  sub-bitstream: A subset of a bitstream. A sub-bitstream is also referred to as a bitstream subset. \nH.3.42  subset: A subset contains only elements that are also contained in the set from which the subset is derived.

elements within these structures (in clause H.7.3 and in \nclause 7.3 by reference in clause H.7.3) are specified in this clause and by reference to clause 7.4. When the semantics of \na syntax element are specified using a table or a set of tables, any values that are not specified in the table(s) shall not be \npresent in the bitstream unless otherwise specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \nH.7.4.1 NAL unit semantics \nThe semantics for the syntax elements in clause H.7.3.1 are specified in clause 7.4.1. The following specifications \nadditionally apply. \nFor NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 14, nal_ref_idc shall be identical to the value of nal_ref_idc for the associated \nNAL unit, which follows the NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 14 in decoding order. \nThe value of nal_ref_idc shall be identical for all VCL NAL units of a view component. \nH.7.4.1.1  NAL unit header MVC extension semantics \nThe syntax elements non_idr_flag, priority_id, view_id, temporal_id, anchor_pic_flag, and inter_view_flag, when present \nin a prefix NAL unit, are considered to apply to the associated NAL unit. \nnon_idr_flag equal to 0 specifies that the current access unit is an IDR access unit. \nThe value of non_idr_flag shall be the same for all VCL NAL units of an access unit. When non_idr_flag is equal to 0 for \na prefix NAL unit, the associated NAL unit shall have nal_unit_type equal to 5. When non_idr_flag is equal to 1 for a \nprefix NAL unit, the associated NAL unit shall have nal_unit_type equal to 1. \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal \nto 14, non_idr_flag shall be inferred to be equal to 1. When nal_unit_type is equal to 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately \npreceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 14, non_idr_flag shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nWhen nal_ref_idc is equal to 0, the value of non_idr_flag shall be equal to 1. \nFor NAL units in which non_idr_flag is present, the variable IdrPicFlag derived in clause 7.4.1 is modified by setting it \nequal to 1 when non_idr_flag is equal to 0, and setting it equal to 0 when non_idr_flag is equal to 1. \npriority_id specifies a priority identifier for the NAL unit. A lower value of priority_id specifies a higher priority. The \nassignment of values to priority_id is constrained by the sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause H.8.5.3. \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 or 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, priority_id shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The syntax element priority_id is not used by the decoding process specified in this Recommendation | International \nStandard. The syntax element priority_id may be used as determined by the application within the specified constraints. \nview_id specifies a view identifier for the NAL unit. NAL units with the same value of view_id belong to the same view. \nThe assignment of values to view_id is constrained by the sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in clause H.8.5.3. \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 or 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, the value of view_id shall be inferred to be equal to 0. When the bitstream does contain NAL units with \nnal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 that are not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 14, it shall not \ncontain data that result in a value of view_id for a view component of any non-base view that is equal to 0. \nThe variable VOIdx, representing the view order index of the view identified by view_id, is set equal to the value of i for \nwhich the syntax element view_id[ i ] included in the referred subset sequence parameter set is equal to view_id. \ntemporal_id specifies a temporal identifier for the NAL unit. \n \n\nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 or 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, temporal_id shall be inferred to be equal to the value of temporal_id for the non-base views in the same access \nunit. \nThe value of temporal_id shall be the same for all prefix and coded slice MVC extension NAL units of an access unit. \nWhen an access unit contains any NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 5 or non_idr_flag equal to 0, temporal_id shall be \nequal to 0. \nThe assignment of values to temporal_id is further constrained by the sub-bitstream extraction process as specified in \nclause H.8.5.3. \nanchor_pic_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current access unit is an anchor access unit. \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 or 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, anchor_pic_flag shall be inferred to be equal to the value of anchor_pic_flag for the non-base views in the \nsame access unit. \nWhen non_idr_flag is equal to 0, anchor_pic_flag shall be equal to 1. \nWhen nal_ref_idc is equal to 0, the value of anchor_pic_flag shall be equal to 0. \nThe value of anchor_pic_flag shall be the same for all VCL NAL units of an access unit. \ninter_view_flag equal to 0 specifies that the current view component is not used for inter-view prediction by any other \nview component in the current access unit. inter_view_flag equal to 1 specifies that the current view component may be \nused for inter-view prediction by other view components in the current access unit. \nWhen nal_unit_type is equal to 1 or 5 and the NAL unit is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, inter_view_flag shall be inferred to be equal to 1. \nThe value of inter_view_flag shall be the same for all VCL NAL units of a view component. \nreserved_one_bit shall be equal to 1. The value 0 for reserved_one_bit may be specified by future extension of this \nRecommendation | International Standard. Decoders shall ignore the value of reserved_one_bit. \nH.7.4.1.2  Order of NAL units and association to coded pictures, access units, and video sequences \nThis clause specifies constraints on the order of NAL units in the bitstream. Any order of NAL units in the bitstream \nobeying these constraints is referred to in the text as the decoding order of NAL units. Within a NAL unit, the syntax in \nclauses 7.3, D.1, E.1, H.7.3, H.13.1, and H.14.1 specifies the decoding order of syntax elements. Decoders shall be capable \nof receiving NAL units and their syntax elements in decoding order. \nH.7.4.1.2.1  Order of MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs and picture parameter set RBSPs and their activation \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The sequence and picture parameter set mechanism decouples the transmission of infrequently changing information \nfrom the transmission of coded macroblock data. Sequence and picture parameter sets may, in some applications, be conveyed \"out-\nof-band\" using a reliable transport mechanism. \nA picture parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by the coded slice NAL units of one or more \nview components of one or more coded pictures. \nEach picture parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding process. At \nmost one picture parameter set RBSP is considered as the active picture parameter set RBSP at any given moment during \nthe operation of the decoding process, and when any particular picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture \nparameter set RBSP, the previously-active picture parameter set RBSP (if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active picture parameter set RBSP, zero or more picture parameter set RBSPs may be specifically active \nfor view components (with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax) that may be referred to through inter-view \nprediction in decoding the view component with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax. Such a picture parameter set RBSP is referred \nto as active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. The restrictions on active picture parameter \nset RBSPs also apply to active view picture parameter set RBSPs for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active picture parameter \nset RBSP and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax (using that value of \npic_parameter_set_id), it is activated. This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active picture parameter set RBSP \nuntil it is deactivated when another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP. A picture \nparameter set RBSP, with that particular value of pic_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to \nits activation. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active view picture \nparameter set for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit with the \nparticular value of VOIdx (using that value of pic_parameter_set_id), it is activated for view components with the particular \n \n\nvalue of VOIdx. This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular \nvalue of VOIdx until it is deactivated when another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active view picture parameter \nset  RBSP  for  the  particular  value  of  VOIdx.  A  picture  parameter  set  RBSP,  with  that  particular  value  of \npic_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nAny picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active picture parameter set \nRBSP for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active picture parameter set RBSP for this coded picture \nunless it follows the last VCL NAL unit of this coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded \npicture. Any picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active view picture \nparameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax for a coded picture shall have the same content \nas that of the active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx for this coded picture unless it \nfollows the last VCL NAL unit of this coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture. \nWhen a picture parameter set NAL unit with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces \nthe content of the previous picture parameter set NAL unit, in decoding order, with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id \n(when a previous picture parameter set NAL unit with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id was present in the \nbitstream). \nNOTE 2 \u2013 A decoder must be capable of simultaneously storing the contents of the picture parameter sets for all values of \npic_parameter_set_id. The content of the picture parameter set with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id is overwritten when \na new picture parameter set NAL unit with the same value of pic_parameter_set_id is received. \nAn MVC sequence parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by one or more picture parameter set \nRBSPs or one or more buffering period SEI messages. \nEach MVC sequence parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding \nprocess. At most one MVC sequence parameter set RBSP is considered as the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP \nat any given moment during the operation of the decoding process, and when any particular MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP becomes the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP, the previously-active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP \n(if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP, zero or more MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs may be \nspecifically active for view components (with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax) that may be referred to \nthrough inter-view prediction in decoding the view component with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax. Such an MVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP is referred to as the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. \nThe restrictions on active MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs also apply to active view MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSPs for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax. \nFor the following specification, the activating buffering period SEI message is specified as follows: \n\u2013  If VOIdxMax is equal to VOIdxMin and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message not included in an \nMVC scalable nesting SEI message, this buffering period SEI message is the activating buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise if VOIdxMax is not equal to VOIdxMin and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message \nincluded in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message and associated with the operation point being decoded, this \nbuffering period SEI message is the activating buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with \nnal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP and \nVOIdxMax is equal to VOIdxMin) and the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message, it is \nactivated. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated \nwhen another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP. A sequence \nparameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to \nits activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI message \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message and VOIdxMax \nis equal to VOIdxMin, it is activated. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP until it is deactivated when another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available \nto the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set \n \n\nRBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice MVC \nextension NAL unit (nal_unit_type is equal to 20) with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax (the picture parameter set RBSP \nbecomes the active picture parameter set RBSP) and the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage, it is activated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP \nuntil it is deactivated when another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the \ndecoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, it is \nactivated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP until it is \ndeactivated when another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP. A \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 The active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP is either a sequence parameter set RBSP or a subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP. Sequence parameter set RBSPs are activated by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 or buffering \nperiod SEI messages that are not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message. Subset sequence parameter sets are activated \nby coded slice MVC extension NAL units (nal_unit_type equal to 20) or buffering period SEI messages that are included in an MVC \nscalable nesting SEI message. A sequence parameter set RBSP and a subset sequence parameter set RBSP may have the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id. \nFor the following specification, the activating view buffering period SEI message for a particular value of VOIdx is \nspecified as follows: \n\u2013  If the access unit contains one or more than one buffering period SEI message included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message and associated with an operation point for which the greatest VOIdx in the associated bitstream subset \nis equal to the particular value of VOIdx, the first of these buffering period SEI messages, in decoding order, is the \nactivating view buffering period SEI message for the particular value of VOIdx. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI \nmessage, this buffering period SEI message is the activating view buffering period SEI message for the particular \nvalue of VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message for the particular value of \nVOIdx. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin and VOIdxMax is greater than \nVOIdxMin and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) \nand the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (the picture \nparameter set RBSP becomes the active view picture parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin), it is activated \nfor view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active view MVC \nsequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin until it is deactivated when another MVC sequence parameter \nset RBSP becomes the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin or when decoding \nan access unit with VOIdxMax equal to VOIdxMin, whichever is earlier. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that \nparticular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin and VOIdxMax is greater than \nVOIdxMin  and  it  is  referred  to  by  an  activating  view  buffering  period  SEI  message  (using  that  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the sequence parameter set RBSP is \nactivated for view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active \nview MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin until it is deactivated when another MVC \nsequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin \nor when decoding an access unit with VOIdxMax equal to VOIdxMin. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular \nvalue of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax \nand it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture \nparameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice MVC extension NAL unit (nal_unit_type equal to 20) with the particular \nvalue of VOIdx (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular \nvalue of VOIdx), it is activated for view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP is called the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx until it is \ndeactivated when another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active view MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP for the particular value of VOIdx or when decoding an access unit with VOIdxMax less than or equal to the particular \n \n\nvalue of VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax \nand it is referred to by an activating view buffering period SEI message (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is \nincluded in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message and associated with the particular value of VOIdx, this subset sequence \nparameter set RBSP is activated for view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP is called the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx until it is \ndeactivated when another MVC sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active view MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP for the particular value of VOIdx or when decoding an access unit with VOIdxMax less than or equal to the particular \nvalue of VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nAn MVC sequence parameter set RBSP that includes a value of profile_idc not specified in Annex A or Annex H shall not \nbe referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP as the active picture parameter set RBSP or as active view \npicture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) or referred to by a buffering period SEI message \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id). An MVC sequence parameter set RBSP including a value of profile_idc not \nspecified in Annex A or Annex H is ignored in the decoding for profiles specified in Annex A or Annex H. \nIt is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the following constraints are obeyed: \n\u2013  For each particular value of VOIdx, all coded slice NAL units of a coded video sequence shall refer to the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id (via the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by the value of pic_parameter_set_id). \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is not included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id in the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred \nto by coded slice NAL units (with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5) (via the value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same \naccess unit. \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message and is associated with a particular value of VOIdx shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id \nin the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by coded slice NAL units with the particular value of VOIdx (via \nthe value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same access unit. \nThe active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs for different values of VOIdx may be the same MVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP. The active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP and an active view MVC sequence parameter set \nRBSP for a particular value of VOIdx may be the same MVC sequence parameter set RBSP. \nWhen the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, any sequence \nparameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of seq_parameter_set_id \nfor the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that of the active MVC sequence \nparameter set RBSP. \nWhen the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set RBSP, any \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of \nseq_parameter_set_id for the active MVC sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that of the active \nMVC sequence parameter set RBSP. \nFor each particular value of VOIdx, the following applies: \n\u2013  When the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, any \nsequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of \nseq_parameter_set_id for the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that of \nthe active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP. \n\u2013  When the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set \nRBSP, any subset sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with \nthe value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content \nas that of the active view MVC sequence parameter set RBSP. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 If picture parameter set RBSPs or MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs are conveyed within the bitstream, these \nconstraints impose an order constraint on the NAL units that contain the picture parameter set RBSPs or MVC sequence parameter \nset RBSPs, respectively. Otherwise (picture parameter set RBSPs or MVC sequence parameter set RBSPs are conveyed by other \nmeans not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard), they must be available to the decoding process in a timely \nfashion such that these constraints are obeyed. \nWhen a sequence parameter set NAL unit with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces \nthe  content  of  the  previous  sequence  parameter  set  NAL  unit,  in  decoding  order,  with  the  same  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id (when a previous sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id \n \n\nwas  present  in  the  bitstream).  When  a  subset  sequence  parameter  set  NAL  unit  with  a  particular  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id is received, its content replaces the content of the previous subset sequence parameter set NAL unit, \nin decoding order, with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id (when a previous subset sequence parameter set NAL unit \nwith the same value of seq_parameter_set_id was present in the bitstream). \nNOTE 5 \u2013 A decoder must be capable of simultaneously storing the contents of the sequence parameter sets and subset sequence \nparameter sets for all values of seq_parameter_set_id. The content of the sequence parameter set with a particular value of \nseq_parameter_set_id is overwritten when a new sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id is \nreceived, and the content of the subset sequence parameter set with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is overwritten when \na new subset sequence parameter set NAL unit with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id is received. \nWhen present, a sequence parameter set extension RBSP includes parameters having a similar function to those of a \nsequence parameter set RBSP. For purposes of establishing constraints on the syntax elements of the sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP and for purposes of determining activation of a sequence parameter set extension RBSP, the sequence \nparameter set extension RBSP shall be considered part of the preceding sequence parameter set RBSP with the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id. When a sequence parameter set RBSP is present that is not followed by a sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id prior to the activation of the sequence parameter set \nRBSP, the sequence parameter set extension RBSP and its syntax elements shall be considered not present for the active \nMVC sequence parameter set RBSP. The contents of sequence parameter set extension RBSPs only apply when the base \nview, which conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, of a coded video sequence conforming to one \nor more profiles specified in Annex H is decoded. Subset sequence parameter set RBSPs shall not be followed by a \nsequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nNOTE 6 \u2013 Sequence parameter sets extension RBSPs are not considered to be part of a subset sequence parameter set RBSP and \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSPs must not be followed by a sequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nFor view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the \nvalues of the syntax elements (and the values of variables derived from those syntax elements) in MVC sequence parameter \nsets and picture parameter sets and other syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the active MVC \nsequence parameter set and the active picture parameter set. For view components with a particular value of VOIdx less \nthan VOIdxMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the values of the syntax elements (and the \nvalues of variables derived from those syntax elements) in MVC sequence parameter sets and picture parameter sets and \nother syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the active view MVC sequence parameter set and \nthe active view picture parameter set for the particular value of VOIdx. If any MVC sequence parameter set RBSP having \nprofile_idc equal to the value of one of the profile_idc values specified in Annex A or Annex H is present that is never \nactivated in the bitstream (i.e., it never becomes the active MVC sequence parameter set or an active view MVC sequence \nparameter set), its syntax elements shall have values that would conform to the specified constraints if it were activated by \nreference in an otherwise-conforming bitstream. If any picture parameter set RBSP is present that is never activated in the \nbitstream (i.e., it never becomes the active picture parameter set or an active view picture parameter set), its syntax elements \nshall have values that would conform to the specified constraints if it were activated by reference in an otherwise-\nconforming bitstream. \nDuring operation of the decoding process (see clause H.8), for view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, the \nvalues of parameters of the active picture parameter set and the active MVC sequence parameter set shall be considered in \neffect. For view components with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax, the values of the parameters of the \nactive view picture parameter set and the active view MVC sequence parameter set for the particular value of VOIdx shall \nbe considered in effect. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply to the entire access unit or the view component with \nVOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, the values of the parameters of the active picture parameter set and the active MVC sequence \nparameter set for the same access unit shall be considered in effect unless otherwise specified in the SEI message semantics. \nFor interpretation of SEI messages that apply to view components with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax, \nthe values of the parameters of the active view picture parameter set and the active view MVC sequence parameter set for \nthe particular value of VOIdx for the same access unit shall be considered in effect unless otherwise specified in the SEI \nmessage semantics. \nH.7.4.1.2.2  Order of access units and association to coded video sequences \nThe specification of clause 7.4.1.2.2 applies with the following modifications. \nThe first access unit of the bitstream shall only contain coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 5 or non_idr_flag \nequal to 0. \nThe order of NAL units and coded pictures and their association to access units is described in clause H.7.4.1.2.3. \nH.7.4.1.2.3  Order of NAL units and coded pictures and association to access units \nThe specification of clause 7.4.1.2.3 applies with the following modifications. \nNOTE \u2013 Some bitstreams that conform to one or more profiles specified in this annex do not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A (prior to operation of the base view extraction process specified in clause H.8.5.4). As specified in clauses 7.4.1 \nand 7.4.1.2.3, for the profiles specified in Annex A, NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 20 are classified as non-VCL NAL units \n \n\nthat must be preceded within each access unit by at least one NAL unit with nal_unit_type in the range of 1 to 5, inclusive. For this \nreason, any bitstream that conforms to one or more profiles specified in this annex does not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A when it contains any of the following: \n\u2013  any access unit that does not contain any NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5, but contains one or more NAL units \nwith nal_unit_type equal to 6, 7, 8, 9, or 15; \n\u2013  any access unit in which one or more NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 7, 8, or 15 is present after the last NAL unit in the \naccess unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5. \nThe association of VCL NAL units to primary or redundant coded pictures is specified in clause H.7.4.1.2.5. \nThe constraints for the detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture are specified in clause H.7.4.1.2.4. \nThe constraint expressed in clause 7.4.1.2.3 on the order of a buffering period SEI message is replaced by the following \nconstraints. \n\u2013  When an SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message is present, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the buffering period SEI message is the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit and it is not \nincluded in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the buffering period SEI message shall be the first SEI \nmessage payload of the first SEI NAL unit in the access unit. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the buffering period SEI message is not the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit or \nit is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message), the following constraints are specified: \n\u2013  When a buffering period SEI message that is not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message is \npresent, this buffering period SEI message shall be the only SEI message payload of the first SEI NAL unit \nin the access unit. \n\u2013  An MVC scalable nesting SEI message that includes a buffering period SEI message shall not include any \nother SEI messages and shall be the only SEI message inside the SEI NAL unit. \n\u2013  All SEI NAL units that precede an SEI NAL unit that contains an MVC scalable nesting SEI message with \na buffering period SEI message as payload in an access unit shall only contain buffering period SEI \nmessages or MVC scalable nesting SEI messages with a buffering period SEI message as payload. \nEach prefix NAL unit shall be immediately followed by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5. \nH.7.4.1.2.4  Detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture \nThis clause specifies constraints on VCL NAL unit syntax that are sufficient to enable the detection of the first VCL NAL \nunit of each primary coded picture. \nThe first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit, in decoding order, shall be different from \nthe last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit, in decoding order, in one or more of the \nfollowing ways: \n\u2013  view_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is different from view_id \nof the last VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit, and VOIdx of the first VCL NAL \nunit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is less than VOIdx of the last VCL NAL unit of the primary \ncoded picture of the previous access unit. \n\u2013  view_id of the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the current access unit is equal to view_id of the \nlast VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture of the previous access unit, and any of the conditions specified in \nclause 7.4.1.2.4 is fulfilled. \nH.7.4.1.2.5  Order of VCL NAL units and association to coded pictures \nEach VCL NAL unit is part of a coded picture. \nLet voIdx be the value of VOIdx of any particular VCL NAL unit. The order of the VCL NAL units within a coded picture \nis constrained as follows: \n\u2013  For all VCL NAL units following this particular VCL NAL unit, the value of VOIdx shall be greater than or equal \nto voIdx. \nFor each set of VCL NAL units within a view component, the following applies: \n\u2013  If arbitrary slice order, as specified in Annex A or clause H.10, is allowed, coded slice NAL units of a view component \nmay have any order relative to each other. \n\u2013  Otherwise (arbitrary slice order is not allowed), coded slice NAL units of a slice group shall not be interleaved with \ncoded slice NAL units of another slice group and the order of coded slice NAL units within a slice group shall be in \n \n\nthe order of increasing macroblock address for the first macroblock of each coded slice NAL unit of the same slice \ngroup. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 12 may be present in the access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL \nunit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive, which are unspecified, may be present in \nthe access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type in the range of 21 to 23, inclusive, which are reserved, shall not precede the first VCL \nNAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit (when specified in the future by ITU-T | ISO/IEC). \nH.7.4.2 Raw byte sequence payloads and RBSP trailing bits semantics \nH.7.4.2.1  Sequence parameter set RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1 apply. \nH.7.4.2.1.1  Sequence parameter set data semantics \nFor all syntax elements other than max_num_ref_frames, the semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.1 apply with the \nsubstitution of MVC sequence parameter set for sequence parameter set. All constraints specified in clause 7.4.2.1.1 apply \nonly to the view components for which the MVC sequence parameter set is the active MVC sequence parameter set or the \nactive view MVC sequence parameter set as specified in clause H.7.4.1.2.1. \nFor each coded video sequence, the active MVC sequence parameter set and all active view MVC sequence parameter sets \n(if  any)  shall  have  the  same  values  of  pic_width_in_mbs_minus1,  pic_height_in_map_units_minus1,  and \nframe_mbs_only_flag. \nWhen  the  seq_parameter_set_data( )  syntax  structure  is  present  in  a  subset  sequence  parameter  set  RBSP  and \nvui_parameters_present_flag is equal to 1, timing_info_present_flag shall be equal to 0, nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag \nshall be equal to 0, vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag shall be equal to 0, and pic_struct_present_flag shall be equal to 0. \nThe value of 1 for timing_info_present_flag, nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag, vcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag, and \npic_struct_present_flag for subset sequence parameter set RBSPs is reserved for future use by ITU-T | ISO/IEC. When \ntiming_info_present_flag is equal to 1, decoders shall ignore the values of the directly following num_units_in_tick, \ntime_scale, fixed_frame_rate_flag syntax elements. When nal_hrd_parameters_present_flag is equal to 1, decoders shall \nignore  the  value  of  the  syntax  elements  in  the  directly  following  hrd_parameters( )  syntax  structure.  When \nvcl_hrd_parameters_present_flag is equal to 1, decoders shall ignore the value of the syntax elements in the directly \nfollowing hrd_parameters( ) syntax structure. \nIf max_num_ref_frames is included in a sequence parameter set, the semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.1 apply. \nOtherwise (max_num_ref_frames is included in a subset sequence parameter set), the following is specified: \nmax_num_ref_frames specifies the maximum number of short-term and long-term reference frames, complementary \nreference field pairs, and non-paired reference fields that may be used by the decoding process for inter prediction of any \nview component in the coded video sequence. max_num_ref_frames also determines the sliding window size of the sliding \nwindow operation as specified in clause H.8.3. The value of max_num_ref_frames shall be in the range of 0 to 16, \ninclusive. \nH.7.4.2.1.1.1 Scaling list semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.1.1 apply. \nH.7.4.2.1.2  Sequence parameter set extension RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.2 apply. Additionally, the following applies. \nSequence parameter set extension RBSPs can only follow sequence parameter set RBSPs in decoding order. Subset \nsequence parameter set RBSPs shall not be followed by a sequence parameter set extension RBSP. The contents of \nsequence parameter set extension RBSPs only apply when the base view, which conforms to one or more of the profiles \nspecified in Annex A, of a coded video sequence conforming to one or more profiles specified in Annex H is decoded. \nH.7.4.2.1.3  Subset sequence parameter set RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.3 apply. \nH.7.4.2.1.4  Sequence parameter set MVC extension semantics \nThe sequence parameter set MVC extension specifies inter-view dependency relationships for the coded video sequence. \nThe sequence parameter set MVC extension also specifies level values for a subset of the operation points for the coded \nvideo sequence. All sequence parameter set MVC extensions that are referred to by a coded video sequence shall be \nidentical. \n \n\nSome views identified by view_id[ i ] may not be present in the coded video sequence. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Some views or temporal subsets described by the sequence parameter set MVC extension may have been removed from \nthe original coded video sequence, hence may not be present in the coded video sequence. However, the information in the sequence \nparameter set MVC extension always applies to the remaining views and temporal subsets. \nnum_views_minus1 plus 1 specifies the maximum number of coded views in the coded video sequence. The value of \nnum_view_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The actual number of views in the coded video sequence may be less than num_views_minus1 plus 1. \nview_id[ i ] specifies the view_id of the view with VOIdx equal to i. The value of view_id[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to \n1023, inclusive. \nnum_anchor_refs_l0[ i ] specifies the number of view components for inter-view prediction in the initial reference picture \nlist RefPicList0 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding anchor view components with VOIdx equal \nto i. The value of num_anchor_refs_l0[ i ] shall not be greater than Min( 15, num_views_minus1 ). The value of \nnum_anchor_refs_l0[ 0 ] shall be equal to 0. \nanchor_ref_l0[ i ][ j ] specifies the view_id of the j-th view component for inter-view prediction in the initial reference \npicture list RefPicList0 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding anchor view components with VOIdx \nequal to i. The value of anchor_ref_l0[ i ][ j ] shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nnum_anchor_refs_l1[ i ] specifies the number of view components for inter-view prediction in the initial reference picture \nlist RefPicList1 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding anchor view components with VOIdx equal \nto i. The value of num_anchor_refs_l1[ i ] shall not be greater than Min( 15, num_views_minus1 ). The value of \nnum_anchor_refs_l1[ 0 ] shall be equal to 0. \nanchor_ref_l1[ i ][ j ] specifies the view_id of the j-th view component for inter-view prediction in the initial reference \npicture list RefPicList1 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding an anchor view component with \nVOIdx equal to i. The value of anchor_ref_l1[ i ][ j ] shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nnum_non_anchor_refs_l0[ i ] specifies the number of view components for inter-view prediction in the initial reference \npicture list RefPicList0 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding non-anchor view components with \nVOIdx equal to i.

The value of non_anchor_ref_l0[ i ][ j ] shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nnum_non_anchor_refs_l1[ i ] specifies the number of view components for inter-view prediction in the initial reference \npicture list RefPicList1 (which is derived as specified in clause H.8.2.1) in decoding non-anchor view components with \nVOIdx equal to i. The value of num_non_anchor_refs_l1[ i ] shall not be greater than Min( 15, num_views_minus1 ).

The specifications in \nclause 8.2.1 apply independently for each view, with \"picture\" being replaced by \"view component\", \"frame\" being \nreplaced by \"frame view component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". \nThe following constraints shall be obeyed: \n\u2013  When the view components of an access unit have field_pic_flag equal to 0 or (field_pic_flag equal to 1 and \nbottom_field_flag equal to 0), it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the bitstream shall not contain data \nthat result in different values of TopFieldOrderCnt for the view components of the access unit. \n\u2013  When the view components of an access unit have field_pic_flag equal to 0 or (field_pic_flag equal to 1 and \nbottom_field_flag equal to 1), it is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the bitstream shall not contain data \nthat result in different values of BottomFieldOrderCnt for the view components of the access unit. \n \n\nH.8.2  MVC decoding process for reference picture lists construction \nThis process is invoked at the beginning of the decoding process for each P, SP or B slice. \nDuring the invocation of this process, when clauses 8.2.4.1 and 8.2.4.2 are invoked, only the reference pictures having the \nsame value of view_id as the current slice are considered. All clauses of clause 8 are invoked with \"picture\" being replaced \nby \"view component\", \"frame\" being replaced by \"frame view component\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view \ncomponent\". \nDecoded reference pictures are marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \"used for long-term reference\" as specified in \nclause H.8.3. Short-term reference pictures are identified by the values of frame_num. Long-term reference pictures are \nassigned a long-term frame index as specified in clause H.8.3. \nIn addition to reference pictures marked as \"used for short-term reference\" or \"used for long-term reference\", inter-view \nreference components and inter-view only reference components of the current access unit may also be included in a \nreference picture list. Inter-view reference components and inter-view only reference components are identified by the \nvalue of view_id. \nClause 8.2.4.1 is invoked to specify \n\u2013  the assignment of variables FrameNum, FrameNumWrap, and PicNum to each of the short-term reference pictures, \nand \n\u2013  the assignment of variable LongTermPicNum to each of the long-term reference pictures. \nReference pictures and, when present, inter-view only reference components, are addressed through reference indices as \nspecified in clause 8.2.4.1. A reference index is an index into a reference picture list. When decoding a P or SP slice, there \nis a single reference picture list RefPicList0. When decoding a B slice, there is a second independent reference picture list \nRefPicList1 in addition to RefPicList0. \nAt the beginning of the decoding process for each slice, reference picture list RefPicList0, and for B slices RefPicList1, \nare derived as specified by the following ordered steps: \n1.  Depending on non_idr_flag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If non_idr_flag is equal to 1, the initial reference picture list RefPicList0 and for B slices RefPicList1 are \nderived as specified in clause 8.2.4.2. \n\u2013  Otherwise (non_idr_flag is equal to 0), all (num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 + 1) entries of the initial \nreference  picture  list  RefPicList0  are  set  equal  to  \"no  reference  picture\"  and,  for  B  slices,  all \n(num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 + 1) entries of the initial reference picture list RefPicList1 are set equal to \n\"no reference picture\". \n2.  Inter-view reference components or inter-view only reference components are appended to the initial reference \npicture list RefPicList0 and for B slices RefPicList1 as specified in clause H.8.2.1. \n3.  When  ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l0  is  equal  to 1  or,  when  decoding  a  B  slice, \nref_pic_list_modification_flag_l1 is equal to 1, the reference picture list RefPicList0 and for B slices RefPicList1 \nare modified as specified in clause H.8.2.2. \nNOTE \u2013 The modification process for reference picture lists specified in clause H.8.2.2 allows the contents of RefPicList0 \nand for B slices RefPicList1 to be modified in a flexible fashion. In particular, it is possible for a reference picture that is \ncurrently marked \"used for reference\" to be inserted into RefPicList0 and for B slices RefPicList1 even when the reference \npicture is not in the initial reference picture list derived as specified in clauses 8.2.4.2 and H.8.2.1. \nThe number of entries in the modified reference picture list RefPicList0 is num_ref_idx_l0_active_minus1 + 1, and for B \nslices the number of entries in the modified reference picture list RefPicList1 is num_ref_idx_l1_active_minus1 + 1. A \nreference picture or inter-view only reference component may appear at more than one index in the modified reference \npicture lists RefPicList0 or RefPicList1. \nDuring the invocation of the process specified in  clause H.8.2.1, an inter-view prediction reference appended to \nRefPicListX (with X being 0 or 1) may not exist. However, an inter-view prediction reference that does not exist shall not \nbe in the modified RefPicListX after the invocation of the process specified in clause H.8.2.2. \nWhen anchor_pic_flag is equal to 1, the bitstream shall not contain data that result in any entry of the reference picture list \nRefPicList0 or, for B slices, any entry of the reference picture list RefPicList1 that does not represent a view component \nof the current access unit. \n \n\nH.8.2.1 Initialization process for reference picture list for inter-view prediction references \nInputs to this process are a reference picture list RefPicListX (with X being 0 or 1), inter_view_flag and view dependency \ninformation that has been decoded from the seq_parameter_set_mvc_extension( ). \nThe output of this process is a possibly modified reference picture list RefPicListX, which is still referred to as the initial \nreference picture list RefPicListX. \nWith i being the value of VOIdx for the current slice, inter-view reference components and inter-view only reference \ncomponents (the corresponding NAL units have inter_view_flag equal to 1) are appended to the reference picture list as \nspecified in the following. \n\u2013  If  the  current  slice  has  anchor_pic_flag  equal  to 1,  for  each  value  of  reference  view  index j  from 0  to \nnum_anchor_refs_lX[ i ] \u2212 1, inclusive, in ascending order of j, the inter-view prediction reference with view_id equal \nto anchor_ref_lX[ i ][ j ] from the same access unit as the current slice is appended to RefPicListX. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current slice has anchor_pic_flag equal to 0), for each value of reference view index j from 0 to \nnum_non_anchor_refs_lX[ i ] \u2212 1, inclusive, in ascending order of j, the inter-view prediction reference with view_id \nequal to non_anchor_ref_lX[ i ][ j ] from the same access unit as the current slice is appended to RefPicListX. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 View components with inter_view_flag equal to 0 are not appended to the reference picture list. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When a NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 is not immediately preceded by a NAL unit with nal_unit_type \nequal to 14, the value of inter_view_flag is inferred to be equal to 1. Encoders that do not encode a prefix NAL unit before each \nNAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 and devices that remove prefix NAL units from a bitstream should take into \nconsideration this inferred value to avoid potential mismatches in the reference picture lists between the encoder and decoder. \nInter-view reference components and inter-view only reference components are appended to the reference picture list \nstarting from the first entry position of \"no reference picture\" in the initial reference picture list RefPicListX or starting \nfrom the entry position num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1+1 of the initial reference picture list RefPicListX, whichever is \nthe earliest position. \nWhen  the  number  of  entries  in  the  initial  reference  picture  list  RefPicListX  is  greater  than \n(num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1), the extra entries past position num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 are discarded from \nthe initial reference picture list RefPicListX. \nH.8.2.2 Modification process for reference picture lists \nInput to this process is reference picture list RefPicList0 and, when decoding a B slice, also reference picture list \nRefPicList1. \nOutputs of this process are a possibly modified reference picture list RefPicList0 and, when decoding a B slice, also a \npossibly modified reference picture list RefPicList1. \nWhen ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l0 is equal to 1, the following ordered steps are specified: \n1.  Let refIdxL0 be an index into the reference picture list RefPicList0. It is initially set equal to 0. \n2.  The corresponding syntax elements modification_of_pic_nums_idc are processed in the order they occur in the \nbitstream. For each of these syntax elements, the following applies: \n\u2013  If modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 0 or equal to 1, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.1 is invoked \nwith RefPicList0 and refIdxL0 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList0 and refIdxL0. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 2, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.2 is invoked \nwith RefPicList0 and refIdxL0 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList0 and refIdxL0. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 4 or equal to 5, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.3 \nis invoked with RefPicList0 and refIdxL0 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList0 and refIdxL0. \n\u2013  Otherwise (modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 3), the modification process for reference picture list \nRefPicList0 is finished. \nWhen ref_pic_list_modification_flag_l1 is equal to 1, the following ordered steps are specified: \n1.  Let refIdxL1 be an index into the reference picture list RefPicList1. It is initially set equal to 0. \n2.  The corresponding syntax elements modification_of_pic_nums_idc are processed in the order they occur in the \nbitstream. For each of these syntax elements, the following applies: \n\u2013  If modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 0 or equal to 1, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.1 is invoked \nwith RefPicList1 and refIdxL1 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList1 and refIdxL1. \n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise, if modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 2, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.2 is invoked \nwith RefPicList1 and refIdxL1 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList1 and refIdxL1. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 4 or equal to 5, the process specified in clause H.8.2.2.3 \nis invoked with RefPicList1 and refIdxL1 given as input, and the output is assigned to RefPicList1 and refIdxL1. \n\u2013  Otherwise (modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 3), the modification process for reference picture list \nRefPicList1 is finished. \nH.8.2.2.1  Modification process of reference picture lists for short-term reference pictures for inter prediction \nInputs to this process are an index refIdxLX and a reference picture list RefPicListX (with X being 0 or 1). \nOutputs of this process are an incremented index refIdxLX and a modified reference picture list RefPicListX. \nThe variable picNumLXNoWrap is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 0, \nif( picNumLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 ) < 0 ) \n  picNumLXNoWrap = picNumLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 ) + MaxPicNum  (H-1) \nelse \n  picNumLXNoWrap = picNumLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 ) \n\u2013  Otherwise (modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 1), \nif( picNumLXPred + ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 )  >=  MaxPicNum ) \n  picNumLXNoWrap = picNumLXPred + ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 ) \u2212 MaxPicNum  (H-2) \nelse \n  picNumLXNoWrap = picNumLXPred + ( abs_diff_pic_num_minus1 + 1 ) \npicNumLXPred is the prediction value for the variable picNumLXNoWrap. When the process specified in this clause is \ninvoked the first time for a slice (that is, for the first occurrence of modification_of_pic_nums_idc equal to 0 or 1 in the \nref_pic_list_modification( ) syntax), picNumL0Pred and picNumL1Pred are initially set equal to CurrPicNum. After each \nassignment of picNumLXNoWrap, the value of picNumLXNoWrap is assigned to picNumLXPred. \nThe variable picNumLX is derived as specified by the following pseudo-code: \nif( picNumLXNoWrap > CurrPicNum ) \n  picNumLX = picNumLXNoWrap \u2212 MaxPicNum  (H-3) \nelse \n  picNumLX = picNumLXNoWrap \npicNumLX shall be equal to the PicNum of a reference picture that is marked as \"used for short-term reference\" and shall \nnot be equal to the PicNum of a short-term reference picture that is marked as \"non-existing\". \nThe following procedure is conducted to place the picture with short-term picture number picNumLX into the index \nposition refIdxLX, shift the position of any other remaining pictures to later in the list, and increment the value of refIdxLX: \nfor( cIdx = num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx > refIdxLX; cIdx\u2212\u2212 ) \n \n  RefPicListX[ cIdx ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx \u2212 1] \nRefPicListX[ refIdxLX++ ] = short-term reference picture with PicNum equal to picNumLX \nnIdx = refIdxLX \nfor( cIdx = refIdxLX; cIdx <= num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx++ )   (H-4) \n  if( PicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) != picNumLX  | |  viewID(RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) != currViewID ) \n    RefPicListX[ nIdx++ ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx ] \nIn the above, the function viewID(refpic) returns the view_id of the reference picture refpic, the variable currViewID is \nequal to the view_id of the current slice, and the function PicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If  the  reference  picture  RefPicListX[ cIdx ]  is  marked  as  \"used  for  short-term  reference\", \nPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is the PicNum of the picture RefPicListX[ cIdx ]. \n\u2013  Otherwise  (the  reference  picture  RefPicListX[ cIdx ]  is  not  marked  as  \"used  for  short-term  reference\"), \nPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is equal to MaxPicNum. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The value of picNumLX can never be equal to MaxPicNum. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 Within this pseudo-code procedure, the length of the list RefPicListX is temporarily made one element longer than the \nlength needed for the final list. After the execution of this procedure, only elements 0 through num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 of \nthe list need to be retained. \n \n\nH.8.2.2.2  Modification process of reference picture lists for long-term reference pictures for inter prediction \nInputs to this process are an index refIdxLX (with X being 0 or 1) and reference picture list RefPicListX. \nOutputs of this process are an incremented index refIdxLX and a modified reference picture list RefPicListX. \nThe following procedure is conducted to place the picture with long-term picture number long_term_pic_num into the \nindex position refIdxLX, shift the position of any other remaining pictures to later in the list, and increment the value of \nrefIdxLX: \nfor( cIdx = num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx > refIdxLX; cIdx\u2212\u2212 ) \n \n  RefPicListX[ cIdx ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx \u2212 1] \nRefPicListX[ refIdxLX++ ] = long-term reference picture with LongTermPicNum equal to long_term_pic_num \nnIdx = refIdxLX \nfor( cIdx = refIdxLX; cIdx <= num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx++ )  (H-5) \n  if( LongTermPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) != long_term_pic_num | | \n       viewID(RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) != currViewID ) \n    RefPicListX[ nIdx++ ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx ] \nIn the above, the function viewID(refpic) returns the view_id of the reference picture refpic, the variable currViewID is \nequal to the view_id of the current slice, and the function LongTermPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If  the  reference  picture  RefPicListX[ cIdx ]  is  marked  as  \"used  for  long-term  reference\", \nLongTermPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is the LongTermPicNum of the picture RefPicListX[ cIdx ]. \n\u2013  Otherwise  (the  reference  picture  RefPicListX[ cIdx ]  is  not  marked  as  \"used  for  long-term  reference\"), \nLongTermPicNumF( RefPicListX[ cIdx ] ) is equal to 2 * ( MaxLongTermFrameIdx + 1 ). \nNOTE 1 \u2013 The value of long_term_pic_num can never be equal to 2 * ( MaxLongTermFrameIdx + 1 ). \nNOTE 2 \u2013 Within this pseudo-code procedure, the length of the list RefPicListX is temporarily made one element longer than the \nlength needed for the final list. After the execution of this procedure, only elements 0 through num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 of \nthe list need to be retained. \nH.8.2.2.3  Modification process for reference picture lists for inter-view prediction references \nInputs to this process are reference picture list RefPicListX (with X being 0 or 1) and an index refIdxLX into this list. \nOutputs of this process are a modified reference picture list RefPicListX (with X being 0 or 1) and an incremented index \nrefIdxLX. \nLet currVOIdx be the variable VOIdx of the current slice. The variable maxViewIdx is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If the current slice has anchor_pic_flag equal to 1, maxViewIdx is set equal to num_anchor_refs_lX[ currVOIdx ] \u2212 1. \n\u2013  Otherwise  (the  current  slice  has  anchor_pic_flag  equal  to 0),  maxViewIdx  is  set  equal  to \nnum_non_anchor_refs_lX[ currVOIdx ] \u2212 1. \nThe variable picViewIdxLX is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 4, \nif( picViewIdxLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) < 0 ) \npicViewIdxLX = picViewIdxLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) + maxViewIdx + 1  (H-6) \nelse \npicViewIdxLX = picViewIdxLXPred \u2212 ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) \n\u2013  Otherwise (modification_of_pic_nums_idc is equal to 5), \nif( picViewIdxLXPred + ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) >= maxViewIdx + 1 ) \npicViewIdxLX = picViewIdxLXPred + ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) \u2212 ( maxViewIdx + 1 )  (H-7) \nelse \npicViewIdxLX = picViewIdxLXPred + ( abs_diff_view_idx_minus1 + 1 ) \npicViewIdxLXPred is the prediction value for the variable picViewIdxLX. When the process specified in this clause is \ninvoked the first time for a slice (that is, for the first occurrence of modification_of_pic_nums_idc equal to 4 or 5 in the \nref_pic_list_modification( ) syntax), picViewIdxL0Pred and picViewIdxL1Pred are initially set equal to \u22121. After each \nassignment of picViewIdxLX, the value of picViewIdxLX is assigned to picViewIdxLXPred. \nThe bitstream shall not contain data that result in picViewIdxLX less than 0 or picViewIdxLX greater than maxViewIdx. \nThe variable targetViewID is derived as follows: \n\u2013  If the current slice has anchor_pic_flag equal to 1, \n \n\ntargetViewID = anchor_refs_lX[ currVOIdx ][ picViewIdxLX ]  (H-8) \n\u2013  Otherwise (the current slice has anchor_pic_flag equal to 0), \ntargetViewID = non_anchor_refs_lX[ currVOIdx ][ picViewIdxLX ]  (H-9) \nThe following procedure is conducted to place the inter-view prediction reference with reference view index equal to \npicViewIdxLX into the index position refIdxLX and shift the position of any other remaining pictures to later in the list: \nfor( cIdx = num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx > refIdxLX; cIdx\u2212\u2212 ) \n \n  RefPicListX[ cIdx ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx \u2212 1] \nRefPicListX[ refIdxLX++ ] = inter-view prediction reference with view_id equal to targetViewID \nnIdx = refIdxLX \nfor( cIdx = refIdxLX; cIdx <= num_ref_idx_lX_active_minus1 + 1; cIdx++ )   (H-10) \n  if( viewID(RefPicListX[ cIdx ]) != targetViewID | | PictureOrderCnt(RefPicListX[ cIdx ]) != currPOC ) \n    RefPicListX[ nIdx++ ] = RefPicListX[ cIdx ] \nIn the above, the function viewID(refpic) returns the view_id of the reference picture refpic, the variable currViewID is \nequal to the view_id of the current slice, and the variable currPOC is equal to PicOrderCnt( ) of the current slice. \nH.8.3  MVC decoded reference picture marking process \nThe process specified in this clause is invoked for a particular view with view order index VOIdx. The specifications in \nclause 8.2.5  apply  with  \"picture\"  being  replaced  by  \"view  component\",  \"frame\"  being  replaced  by  \"frame  view \ncomponent\", and \"field\" being replaced by \"field view component\". During the invocation of the process for a particular \nview, only view components of the particular view are considered. The marking of view components of other views is not \nchanged. \nNOTE \u2013 A view component of a picture may have a different marking status than other view components of the same picture. \nH.8.4  MVC inter prediction and inter-view prediction process \nFor both inter-prediction and inter-view prediction, the specifications in clause 8.4 apply. For the invocation of the MVC \ninter prediction and inter-view prediction process as specified in this clause, the inter-view reference components and inter-\nview only reference components that are included in the reference picture lists are considered as not being marked as \"used \nfor short-term reference\" or \"used for long-term reference\". \nNOTE \u2013 This implies that when RefPicList1[ 0 ] represents an inter-view reference component or an inter-view only reference \ncomponent, the variable colZeroFlag in clause 8.4.1.2.2 is always derived to be equal to 0. \nWhen mfc_format_idc is present, the additional processing for an inter-view prediction reference as specified in \nclause H.8.4.1 is invoked before the inter-view prediction reference is used for inter-view prediction. \nH.8.4.1 Additional processing for an inter-view prediction reference \nThis process is invoked when mfc_format_idc is present to modify each colour component array of an inter-view prediction \nreference used in decoding view components of the non-base view. When rpu_filter_enabled_flag is equal to 1, the \nmodification process consists of a one-dimensional downsampling filtering process followed by a one-dimensional \nupsampling filtering process. The modification process converts an inter-view prediction reference from the frame packing \narrangement format of the view components in the base view to the frame packing arrangement format of the view \ncomponents in the non-base view.

In this case, each coded video sequence in a sub-bitstream must still conform to one or more \nof the profiles specified in Annex A and Annex H, but may not satisfy the level constraints specified in clauses A.3 and H.10.2, \nrespectively. \n \n\nInputs to this process are: \n\u2013  a variable pIdTarget (when present), \n\u2013  a variable tIdTarget (when present), \n\u2013  a list viewIdTargetList consisting of one or more values of viewIdTarget (when present). \nOutputs of this process are a sub-bitstream and a list of VOIdx values VOIdxList. \nWhen pIdTarget is not present as input to this clause, pIdTarget is inferred to be equal to 63. \nWhen tIdTarget is not present as input to this clause, tIdTarget is inferred to be equal to 7. \nWhen viewIdTargetList is not present as input to this clause, there shall be one value of viewIdTarget inferred in \nviewIdTargetList and the value of viewIdTarget is inferred to be equal to view_id of the base view. \nThe sub-bitstream is derived by applying the following operations in sequential order: \n1.  Let VOIdxList be empty and minVOIdx be the VOIdx value of the base view. \n2.  For each value of viewIdTarget included in viewIdTargetList, invoke the process specified in clause H.8.5.1 with \nthe value of viewIdTarget as input. \n3.  For each value of viewIdTarget included in viewIdTargetList, invoke the process specified in clause H.8.5.2 with \nthe value of viewIdTarget as input. \n4.  Mark all VCL NAL units and filler data NAL units for which any of the following conditions are true as \"to be \nremoved from the bitstream\": \n\u2013  priority_id is greater than pIdTarget, \n\u2013  temporal_id is greater than tIdTarget, \n\u2013  view_id is not in the viewIdTargetList. \n5.  Remove all access units for which all VCL NAL units are marked as \"to be removed from the bitstream\". \n6.  Remove all VCL NAL units and filler data NAL units that are marked as \"to be removed from the bitstream\". \n7.  When VOIdxList contains only one value of VOIdx that is equal to minVOIdx, remove the following NAL units: \n\u2013  all NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 14 or 15, \n\u2013  all NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 6 in which the first SEI message has payloadType in the range \nof 36 to 44, inclusive, or equal to 46. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 When VOIdxList contains only one value of VOIdx equal to minVOIdx, the sub-bitstream contains only the base \nview or only a temporal subset of the base view. \n8.  Let maxTId be the maximum temporal_id of all the remaining VCL NAL units. Remove all NAL units with \nnal_unit_type equal to 6 that only contain SEI messages that are part of an MVC scalable nesting SEI message \nwith any of the following properties: \n\u2013  operation_point_flag  is  equal  to 0  and  all_view_components_in_au_flag  is  equal  to 0  and  none  of \nsei_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_minus1, inclusive, corresponds to a \nVOIdx value included in VOIdxList, \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 1 and either sei_op_temporal_id is greater than maxTId or the list of \nsei_op_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, is not a subset \nof  viewIdTargetList  (i.e.,  it  is  not  true  that  sei_op_view_id[ i ]  for  any  i  in  the  range  of 0  to \nnum_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, is equal to a value in viewIdTargetList). \n9.  Remove each view scalability information SEI message and each operation point not present SEI message, when \npresent. \n10. When VOIdxList does not contain a value of VOIdx equal to minVOIdx, the view with VOIdx equal to the \nminimum VOIdx value included in VOIdxList is converted to the base view of the extracted sub-bitstream. An \ninformative procedure that outlines key processing steps to create a base view is described in clause H.8.5.5. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 When VOIdxList does not contain a value of VOIdx equal to minVOIdx, the resulting sub-bitstream \naccording to the operation steps 1-9 above does not contain a base view that conforms to one or more profiles specified \nin Annex A. In this case, by this operation step, the remaining view with the new minimum VOIdx value is converted \nto be the new base view that conforms to one or more profiles specified in Annex A. \n \n\nH.8.5.4 Specification of the base view bitstream \nA bitstream that conforms to one or more profiles as specified in Annex H shall contain a base view bitstream that conforms \nto one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A. This base view bitstream is derived by invoking the sub-bitstream \nextraction process as specified in clause H.8.5.3 with no input and the base view bitstream being the output. \nNOTE \u2013 Although all multiview bitstreams that conform to one or more of the profiles specified in this annex contain a base view \nbitstream that conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, the complete multiview bitstream (prior to operation of \nthe base view extraction process specified in this clause) may not conform to any profile specified in Annex A. \nH.8.5.5 Creation of a base view during sub-bitstream extraction (informative) \nAccording to the sub-bitstream extraction process specified in clause H.8.5.3, the resulting sub-bitstream shall contain a \nbase view. When the resulting bitstream does not contain a base view, the following procedure may be used to create a \nbase view during sub-bitstream extraction. \nWhen VOIdxList does not contain a value of VOIdx equal to minVOIdx, let newBaseViewId be equal to the view_id for \nwhich the VOIdx value is equal to the minimum VOIdx value included in VOIdxList, and apply the following operations \nin sequential order: \n1.  Remove all NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 7. \n2.  For all subset sequence parameter set NAL units (with nal_unit_type equal to 15) that are referred to by at least \none remaining VCL NAL unit with view_id equal to newBaseViewId, apply the following operations in \nsequential order: \na.  Set nal_unit_type to 7. \nb.  Set profile_idc to 100. \nc.  Set level_idc to level_idc[ i ], with i equal to the value that for one value of j in the range of 0 to \nnum_applicable_ops_minus1[ i ],  inclusive,  applicable_op_temporal_id[ i ][ j ]  is  equal  to  maxTId, \napplicable_op_num_target_views_minus1[ i ][ j ]  is  equal  to 0,  and \napplicable_op_target_view_id[ i ][ j ][ k ] for k equal to 0 is equal to newBaseViewId. \nd.  Remove all the syntax elements after the syntax structure seq_parameter_set_data( ) and before the syntax \nstructure rbsp_trailing_bits( ), and change RBSP trailing bits appropriately. \n3.  Remove all SEI NAL units (with nal_unit_type equal to 6) for which the first contained SEI message has \npayloadType in the range of 0 to 23, inclusive. \n4.  For each SEI NAL unit (with nal_unit_type equal to 6) containing an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the \nfollowing operations are applied in sequential order: \na.  When none of the following properties is true for the MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the SEI NAL unit \nis removed: \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 0 and all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 1, \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 0, all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 0, and at least one of \nthe values of sei_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_minus1, inclusive, is \nequal to the value of one of the viewIdTarget's in viewIdTargetList, \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 1, sei_op_temporal_id is equal to or less than maxtIdT, and the list of \nsei_op_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, is a \nsubset of viewIdTargetList (i.e., it is true that sei_op_view_id[ i ] for any i in the range of 0 to \nnum_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, is equal to a value in viewIdTargetList). \nb.  When the SEI NAL unit is not removed, the following applies: \n\u2013  If VOIdxList contains only one VOIdx value, the SEI NAL unit is replaced by an SEI NAL unit \ncontaining only the original nested SEI message not as part of an MVC scalable nesting SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise (VOIdxList contains more than one VOIdx value), when any of the following properties is \ntrue for the MVC scalable nesting SEI message, a new SEI NAL unit containing only the nested SEI \nmessage not as part of an MVC scalable nesting SEI message is generated and inserted immediately \nbefore the original SEI NAL unit in decoding order: \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 0 and all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 1, \n\u2013  operation_point_flag is equal to 0, all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 0, and for the \nvalues of sei_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_minus1, inclusive, \n \n\none is equal to newBaseViewId, and at least another one is equal to the value of one of the \nviewIdTarget's in viewIdTargetList. \n5.  When VOIdxList contains only one value of VOIdx, remove the following NAL units: \n\u2013  all NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 15, \n\u2013  all NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 6 in which the first SEI message has payloadType in the range \nof 36 to 44, inclusive. \n6.  For each NAL unit nalUnit with nal_unit_type equal to 20 and view_id equal to newBaseViewId, the following \noperations are applied in sequential order: \na.  Depending on non_idr_flag, the following applies: \n\u2013  If non_idr_flag is equal to 0, set nal_unit_type equal to 5. \n\u2013  Otherwise (non_idr_flag is equal to 1), set nal_unit_type equal to 1. \nb.  When VOIdxList contains more than one VOIdx value, generate a prefix NAL unit with the same NAL unit \nheader (including NAL unit header MVC extension) as the NAL unit nalUnit, except that nal_unit_type is \nset to 14 and priority_id may be changed, and insert the prefix NAL unit immediately before the NAL unit \nnalUnit in decoding order. After the last application of this operation, at least one of all the inserted prefix \nNAL units by the applications of this operation shall have priority_id equal to 0. \nc.  Remove the NAL unit header MVC extension of nalUnit. \nH.8.6  MFC enhanced resolution picture reconstruction \nThis clause does not form an integral part of this Recommendation | International Standard. \nThis informative clause describes a process for reconstructing the enhanced resolution stereo views from the coded video \nsequences conforming to the MFC High profile.

The \nnumber of motion vectors for each macroblock is the value of the variable MvCnt after the completion of the intra \nor inter prediction process for the macroblock. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 When separate_colour_plane_flag is equal to 0, the constraint specifies that the total number of motion \nvectors  for  two  consecutive  macroblocks  in  decoding  order  must  not  exceed  MaxMvsPer2Mb.

Each entry in Tables A-1 \nand A-4 indicates, for the level corresponding to the row of the table, the absence or value of a limit that is imposed by the \nvariable corresponding to the column of the table, as follows: \n\u2013  If the table entry is marked as \"-\", no limit is imposed by the value of the variable as a requirement of bitstream \nconformance to the profile at the specified level. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the table entry specifies the value of the variable for the associated limit that is imposed as a requirement \nof bitstream conformance to the profile at the specified level. \nFor coded video sequences conforming to the Multiview High, Stereo High, or MFC High profile, the level_idc value is \nspecified as follows: \n\u2013  If level_idc is not equal to 0, level_idc indicates the level that applies to the coded video sequence operating with all \nthe views being target output views. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 A level_idc value that is not equal to zero may indicate a higher level than necessary to decode the coded video \nsequence operating with all the views being target output views.

When \npayloadType is equal to 10 for the SEI message that is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the \nsemantics for sub_seq_layer_num of the sub-sequence information SEI message is modified as follows: \nsub_seq_layer_num specifies the sub-sequence layer number of the current picture. When the current \npicture resides in a sub-sequence for which the first picture in decoding order is an IDR picture, the value \nof sub_seq_layer_num shall be equal to 0. For a non-paired reference field, the value of sub_seq_layer_num \nshall be equal to 0. sub_seq_layer_num shall be in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if payloadType is equal to 0 or 1, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the SEI message is not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the following applies. When the \nSEI message and all other SEI messages with payloadType equal to 0 or 1 not included in an MVC scalable \nnesting SEI message are used as the buffering period and picture timing SEI messages for checking the bitstream \nconformance according to Annex C and the decoding process specified in clauses 2 to 9 is used, the bitstream \nshall be conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the SEI message is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message), the following applies.

The scope to which the nested SEI message applies is indicated by the syntax \nelements operation_point_flag, all_view_components_in_au_flag, num_view_components_minus1, sei_view_id[ i ] for \nall i, num_view_components_op_minus1, sei_op_view_id[ i ] for all i, and sei_op_temporal_id. \nSome view components to which the nested SEI message applies may not be present in the access unit containing the MVC \nscalable nesting SEI message. \noperation_point_flag equal to 1 specifies that the nested SEI message applies to the current access unit when the \nassociated operation point identified by sei_op_temporal_id and sei_op_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to \nnum_view_components_op_minus1, inclusive, is decoded. operation_point_flag equal to 0 specifies that the nested SEI \nmessage applies to the view components identified by all_view_components_in_au_flag, num_view_components_minus1, \nand sei_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to num_view_components_minus1, inclusive, regardless of which operation \npoint is decoded. \nIf the nested SEI message has payloadType equal to 0 or 1, operation_point_flag shall be equal to 1. Otherwise (the nested \nSEI message has payloadType not equal to 0 or 1), operation_point_flag shall be equal to 0. \nall_view_components_in_au_flag equal to 1 specifies that the nested SEI message applies to all view components of the \naccess unit. all_view_components_in_au_flag equal to 0 specifies that the applicable scope of the nested SEI message is \nsignalled by the syntax elements num_view_components_minus1 and sei_view_id[ i ] for all i in the range of 0 to \nnum_view_components_minus1, inclusive. \nnum_view_components_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of view components to which the nested SEI message \napplies when operation_point_flag is equal to 0 and all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 0. The value of \nnum_view_components_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nsei_view_id[ i ] specifies the view_id of the i-th view component to which the nested SEI message applies when \noperation_point_flag is equal to 0 and all_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 0. \nnum_view_components_op_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of view components of the operation point to which the \nnested SEI message applies when operation_point_flag is equal to 1. The value of num_view_components_op_minus1 \nshall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \n \n\nsei_op_view_id[ i ] specifies the view_id of the i-th view component to which the nested SEI message applies when \noperation_point_flag is equal to 1. \nsei_op_temporal_id specifies the maximum temporal_id of the bitstream subset to which the nested SEI message applies \nwhen operation_point_flag is equal to 1. \nsei_nesting_zero_bit is equal to 0. \nH.13.2.3 View scalability information SEI message semantics \nWhen present, this SEI message shall be associated with an IDR access unit. The semantics of the message are valid for \nthe current coded video sequence. A view scalability information SEI message contains view and scalability information \nfor a subset of the operation points in the coded video sequence. Each operation point is associated with an operation point \nidentifier. The sub-bitstream for an operation point is referred to as the operation point representation or the representation \nof the operation point. Information such as bit rate and frame rate, among others, are signalled for the representations of \nthe subset of the operation points. \nNOTE 1 \u2013 Any operation point for which view and scalability information is signalled in a view scalability information SEI message \n(i.e. identified by a value of operation_point_id[ i ]) must be present in the coded video sequence. When an application keeps a \nview scalability information SEI message in a sub-bitstream extracted according to the process specified in clause H.8.5.3, and \nafter the extraction any operation point for which view and scalability information is signalled in the original SEI message becomes \nnot present in the coded video sequence, the application must change the content of the view scalability information SEI message \nto fulfil the condition stated by the first sentence in this note. \nnum_operation_points_minus1 plus 1 specifies the number of operation points that are present in the coded video \nsequence and for which the view scalability information is signalled by the following syntax elements. The value of \nnum_operation_points_minus1 shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nThe bitstream subset corresponding to an operation point is defined as the  operation point representation or the \nrepresentation of the operation point. The representation of the operation point identified by operation_point_id[ i ] is the \noutput of the sub-bitstream extraction process specified in clause H.8.5.3 with tIdTarget equal to temporal_id[ i ] and \nviewIdTargetList consisting of view_id[ i ][ j ] for all j in the range of 0 to num_target_output_views_minus1[ i ], \ninclusive, as the inputs. \noperation_point_id[ i ] specifies the identifier of the operation point. Each operation point is associated with a unique \noperation point identifier. The value of operation_point_id[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 65535, inclusive. \nIn the following semantics in this clause, the operation point with identifier equal to operation_point_id[ i ] is referred to \nas the current operation point. \npriority_id[ i ] and temporal_id[ i ] specify the maximum value of priority_id and temporal_id, respectively, of the NAL \nunits in the representation of the current operation point. \nnum_target_output_views_minus1[ i ] plus 1 specifies the number of target output views for the current operation point. \nThe value of num_target_output_views_minus1[ i ] shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nview_id[ i ][ j ] specifies the identifier of the j-th target output view for the current operation point. The value of \nview_id[ i ][ j ] shall be in the range of 0 to 1023, inclusive. \nprofile_level_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 1 specifies that the profile and level information for the representation of the \ncurrent operation point is present in the SEI message. profile_level_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 0 specifies that the \nprofile and level information for the current operation point is not present in the SEI message. \nbitrate_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 1 specifies  that the bitrate information for the current operation point is present in \nthe SEI message. bitrate_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 0 specifies that the bitrate information for the current operation \npoint is not present in the SEI message. \nfrm_rate_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 1 specifies that the frame rate information for the current operation point is \npresent in the SEI message. frm_rate_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 0 specifies that the frame rate information for the \ncurrent operation point is not present in the SEI message. \nview_dependency_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 1 specifies that information on the views the target output view of the \ncurrent operation point directly depends on is present in the SEI message. View A is directly dependent on view point B if \nthere is at least one view component of view A using a view component of view B for inter-view prediction reference. \nview_dependency_info_present_flag[ i ] equal to 0 specifies that view_dependency_info_src_op_id[ i ] is present in the \nSEI message. When not present, view_dependency_info_present_flag[ i ] shall be inferred to be equal to 0. \n \n\nNOTE 2 \u2013 The inter-view dependency relationship signalled in sequence parameter set MVC extension is an upper bound, in the \nsense that whenever view A may depend on view B at any access unit, it is specified as view A depends on view B. Therefore, the \ndependency relationship is indicated by sequence parameter set MVC extension when view A depends on view B at only one of all \naccess units in the coded video sequence, or even when view A actually does not depend on view B at any access unit but when \ngenerating the sequence parameter set MVC extension the encoder thought view A might depend on view B. The dependency \nrelationship signalled here can be more refined.

Within a NAL unit, the syntax in \nclauses 7.3, D.1, E.1, H.7.3, H.13.1, H.14.1, I.13.1 and I.14.1 specifies the decoding order of syntax elements.

Sequence and picture parameter sets may, in some applications, be conveyed \"out-\nof-band\" using a reliable transport mechanism. \nA picture parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by the coded slice NAL units of one or more \ntexture view or depth view components of one or more coded pictures. \nEach picture parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding process. At \nmost one picture parameter set RBSP is considered as the active picture parameter set RBSP at any given moment during \nthe operation of the decoding process, and when any particular picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture \nparameter set RBSP, the previously-active picture parameter set RBSP (if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active picture parameter set RBSP, zero or more picture parameter set RBSPs may be specifically active \nfor texture view components (with a particular value of VOIdx less than or equal to VOIdxMax) that belong to the target \noutput views or that may be referred to through inter-view prediction in decoding texture view components belonging to \nthe target output views. Such a picture parameter set RBSP is referred to as the active texture picture parameter set RBSP \nfor the particular value of VOIdx. The restrictions on active picture parameter set RBSPs also apply to active texture picture \nparameter set RBSPs for a particular value of VOIdx. \nFurthermore, zero or more picture parameter set RBSPs may be specifically active for depth view components (with a \nparticular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax) that belong to the target output views or that may be referred to through \ninter-view prediction in decoding depth view components belonging to the target output views. Such a picture parameter \nset RBSP is referred to as the active depth picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. The restrictions \non active picture parameter set RBSPs also apply to active depth picture parameter set RBSPs for a particular value of \nVOIdx less than VOIdxMax. \n \n\nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active picture parameter \nset RBSP and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit belonging to a depth view component (i.e., with nal_unit_type \nequal to 21) and with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax (using that value of pic_parameter_set_id), it is activated. This picture \nparameter set RBSP is called the active picture parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated when another picture parameter \nset RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP. A picture parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of \npic_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active depth picture \nparameter set for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit belonging \nto a depth view component (i.e., with nal_unit_type equal to 21) and with the particular value of VOIdx (using that value \nof pic_parameter_set_id), it is activated for view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This picture parameter \nset RBSP is called the active depth picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx until it is deactivated \nwhen another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active depth picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of \nVOIdx. A picture parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of pic_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nWhen a picture parameter set RBSP (with a particular value of pic_parameter_set_id) is not the active texture picture \nparameter set for a particular value of VOIdx less than or equal to VOIdxMax and it is referred to by a coded slice NAL \nunit belonging to a texture view component (i.e., with nal_unit_type equal to 1, 5 or 20) and with the particular value of \nVOIdx (using that value of pic_parameter_set_id), it is activated for texture view components with the particular value of \nVOIdx. This picture parameter set RBSP is called the active texture picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of \nVOIdx until it is deactivated when another picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active texture picture parameter set \nRBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. A picture parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of pic_parameter_set_id, \nshall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nAny picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active picture parameter set \nRBSP for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active picture parameter set RBSP for this coded picture \nunless it follows the last VCL NAL unit of this coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded \npicture. Any picture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active depth picture \nparameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax for a coded picture shall have the same content \nas that of the active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx for this coded picture unless it \nfollows the last VCL NAL unit of this coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture. Any \npicture parameter set NAL unit containing the value of pic_parameter_set_id for the active texture picture parameter set \nRBSP for a particular value of VOIdx for a coded picture shall have the same content as that of the active texture picture \nparameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx for this coded picture unless it follows the last VCL NAL unit of \nthis coded picture and precedes the first VCL NAL unit of another coded picture. \nAn MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP includes parameters that can be referred to by one or more picture parameter set \nRBSPs or one or more buffering period SEI messages. \nEach MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding \nprocess. At most one MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP is considered as the active MVCD sequence parameter set \nRBSP at any given moment during the operation of the decoding process, and when any particular MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP becomes the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP, the previously-active MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP (if any) is deactivated. \nIn addition to the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP, zero or more MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs may \nbe specifically active for view components (with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax) that belong to the target \noutput views or that may be referred to through inter-view prediction in decoding view components belonging to the target \noutput views. Such an MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP is referred to as the active view MVCD sequence parameter \nset RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. The restrictions on active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs also apply \nto active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax. \nFurthermore, zero or more MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs may be specifically active for texture view components \n(with a particular value of VOIdx less than or equal to VOIdxMax) that belong to the target output views or that may be \nreferred to through inter-view prediction in decoding texture view components belonging to the target output views. Such \nan MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP is referred to as the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the \nparticular value of VOIdx. The restrictions on active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs also apply to active texture \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs for a particular value of VOIdx. \nFor the following specification, the activating buffering period SEI message is specified as follows. \n\u2013  If VOIdxMax is equal to VOIdxMin and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message not included in an \nMVC scalable nesting SEI message and not included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, this buffering period \nSEI message is the activating buffering period SEI message. \n \n\n\u2013  Otherwise if VOIdxMax is not equal to VOIdxMin and the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message \nincluded in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message and associated with the operation point being decoded, this \nbuffering period SEI message is the activating buffering period SEI message. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI message. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with \nnal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active picture parameter set RBSP and \nVOIdxMax is equal to VOIdxMin and there is no depth view component in any access unit) and the access unit does not \ncontain an activating buffering period SEI message, it is activated. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes \nthe active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of \nseq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI message \n(using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message and VOIdxMax \nis equal to VOIdxMin and there is no depth view component in the access unit, it is activated. This sequence parameter set \nRBSP is called the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP becomes the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. A sequence parameter set RBSP, with that \nparticular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set \nRBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice depth \nextension NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 21 and with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax (the picture parameter set RBSP \nbecomes the active picture parameter set RBSP) and the access unit does not contain an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage, it is activated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVCD sequence parameter set \nRBSP until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and it is referred to by an activating buffering period SEI \nmessage (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, it is \nactivated. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP until it is \ndeactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \nA subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the \ndecoding process prior to its activation. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP is either a sequence parameter set RBSP or a subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP. Sequence parameter set RBSPs are activated by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 or buffering \nperiod SEI messages that are not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message or an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message. \nSubset sequence parameter sets are activated by coded slice depth extension NAL units (nal_unit_type equal to 21) or buffering \nperiod SEI messages that are included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message. A sequence parameter set RBSP and a subset \nsequence parameter set RBSP may have the same value of seq_parameter_set_id. \nFor the following specification, the activating texture buffering period SEI message for a particular value of VOIdx is \nspecified as follows. \n\u2013  If the access unit contains one or more than one buffering period SEI message included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message and associated with an operation point for which the greatest VOIdx in the associated bitstream subset \nis equal to the particular value of VOIdx, the first of these buffering period SEI messages, in decoding order, is the \nactivating texture buffering period SEI message for the particular value of VOIdx. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if the access unit contains a buffering period SEI message not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI \nmessage or an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, this buffering period SEI message is the activating texture \nbuffering period SEI message for the particular value of VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating texture buffering period SEI message for the particular value \nof VOIdx. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin and it is referred to by \nactivation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture parameter set RBSP \nis activated by a coded slice NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the \nactive texture picture parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin), it is activated for texture view components with \n \n\nVOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set \nRBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes \nthe active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. A sequence parameter set RBSP, \nwith that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 7) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id is not \nalready the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin and it is referred to by an \nactivating texture buffering period SEI message (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is not included in an MVC \nscalable nesting SEI message or an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, the sequence parameter set RBSP is activated \nfor texture view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin. This sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active \ntexture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to VOIdxMin until it is deactivated when another MVCD \nsequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for VOIdx equal to. A \nsequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding \nprocess prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than or equal to \nVOIdxMax and it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) \nand the picture parameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice MVC extension NAL unit (nal_unit_type equal to 20) \nwith the particular value of VOIdx (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active texture picture parameter set RBSP \nfor the particular value of VOIdx), it is activated for texture view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular \nvalue of VOIdx until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active texture \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that \nparticular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than or equal to \nVOIdxMax  and  it  is  referred  to  by  an  activating  texture  buffering  period  SEI  message  (using  that  value  of \nseq_parameter_set_id) that is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message and associated with the particular value \nof VOIdx, this subset sequence parameter set RBSP is activated for texture view components with the particular value of \nVOIdx. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP is called the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the \nparticular value of VOIdx until it is deactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active \ntexture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, \nwith that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nFor the following specification, the activating view buffering period SEI message for a particular value of VOIdx is \nspecified as follows. \n\u2013  If the access unit contains one or more than one buffering period SEI message included in an MVCD scalable nesting \nSEI message and associated with an operation point for which the greatest VOIdx in the associated bitstream subset \nis equal to the particular value of VOIdx, the first of these buffering period SEI messages, in decoding order, is the \nactivating view buffering period SEI message for the particular value of VOIdx. \n\u2013  Otherwise, the access unit does not contain an activating view buffering period SEI message for the particular value \nof VOIdx. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax \nand it is referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) and the picture \nparameter set RBSP is activated by a coded slice NAL unit with nal_unit_type equal to 21 and with the particular value of \nVOIdx (the picture parameter set RBSP becomes the active view picture parameter set RBSP for the particular value of \nVOIdx), it is activated for view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This subset sequence parameter set RBSP \nis called the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx until it is deactivated \nwhen another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for \nthe particular value of VOIdx or when decoding an access unit with VOIdxMax less than or equal to the particular value \nof VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be available \nto the decoding process prior to its activation. \nWhen a subset sequence parameter set RBSP (nal_unit_type is equal to 15) with a particular value of seq_parameter_set_id \nis not already the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax \nand it is referred to by an activating view buffering period SEI message (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id) that is \nincluded in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message and associated with the particular value of VOIdx, this subset sequence \nparameter set RBSP is activated for view components with the particular value of VOIdx. This subset sequence parameter \nset RBSP is called the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for the particular value of VOIdx until it is \ndeactivated when another MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP becomes the active view MVCD sequence parameter set \n \n\nRBSP for the particular value of VOIdx or when decoding an access unit with VOIdxMax less than or equal to the particular \nvalue of VOIdx. A subset sequence parameter set RBSP, with that particular value of seq_parameter_set_id, shall be \navailable to the decoding process prior to its activation. \nAn MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP that includes a value of profile_idc not specified in Annex A or Annex H or \nAnnex I shall not be referred to by activation of a picture parameter set RBSP as the active picture parameter set RBSP or \nas active view picture parameter set RBSP or as active texture picture parameter set RBSP (using that value of \nseq_parameter_set_id) or referred to by a buffering period SEI message (using that value of seq_parameter_set_id). An \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSP including a value of profile_idc not specified in Annex A or Annex H or Annex I is \nignored in the decoding for profiles specified in Annex A or Annex H or Annex I. \nIt is a requirement of bitstream conformance that the following constraints are obeyed: \n\u2013  For each particular value of VOIdx, all coded slice NAL units (with nal_unit_type equal to 1, 5, 20, or 21) of a coded \nvideo sequence shall refer to the same value of seq_parameter_set_id (via the picture parameter set RBSP that is \nreferred to by the value of pic_parameter_set_id). \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is not included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id in the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred \nto by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5 (via the value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same \naccess unit. \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is included in an MVC scalable nesting \nSEI message and is associated with a particular value of VOIdx shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id \nin the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1, 5 or 20 \nwith the particular value of VOIdx (via the value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same access unit. \n\u2013  The value of seq_parameter_set_id in a buffering period SEI message that is included in an MVCD scalable nesting \nSEI message and is associated with a particular value of VOIdx shall be identical to the value of seq_parameter_set_id \nin the picture parameter set RBSP that is referred to by coded slice NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 21 with the \nparticular value of VOIdx (via the value of pic_parameter_set_id) in the same access unit. \nThe active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs for different values of VOIdx may be the same MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP. The active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and an active view MVCD sequence parameter set \nRBSP for a particular value of VOIdx may be the same MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \nThe active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs for different values of VOIdx may be the same MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP. The active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP and an active texture MVCD sequence parameter \nset RBSP for a particular value of VOIdx may be the same MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \nWhen the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, any sequence \nparameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of seq_parameter_set_id \nfor the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that of the active MVCD sequence \nparameter set RBSP. \nWhen the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set RBSP, any \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of \nseq_parameter_set_id for the active MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that of the active \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \nFor each particular value of VOIdx, the following applies: \n\u2013  When the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a sequence parameter set RBSP, \nany sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the value of \nseq_parameter_set_id for the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content as that \nof the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \n\u2013  When the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set \nRBSP, any subset sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with \nthe value of seq_parameter_set_id for the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same \ncontent as that of the active texture MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \n\u2013  The active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP for a coded picture is a subset sequence parameter set RBSP, \nand any subset sequence parameter set RBSP in the coded video sequence containing this coded picture and with the \nvalue of seq_parameter_set_id for the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP shall have the same content \nas that of the active view MVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 If picture parameter set RBSPs or MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs are conveyed within the bitstream, these \nconstraints impose an order constraint on the NAL units that contain the picture parameter set RBSPs or MVCD sequence parameter \nset RBSPs, respectively. Otherwise (picture parameter set RBSPs or MVCD sequence parameter set RBSPs are conveyed by other \n \n\nmeans not specified in this Recommendation | International Standard), they must be available to the decoding process in a timely \nfashion such that these constraints are obeyed. \nWhen present, a sequence parameter set extension RBSP includes parameters having a similar function to those of a \nsequence parameter set RBSP. For purposes of establishing constraints on the syntax elements of the sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP and for purposes of determining activation of a sequence parameter set extension RBSP, the sequence \nparameter set extension RBSP shall be considered part of the preceding sequence parameter set RBSP with the same value \nof seq_parameter_set_id. When a sequence parameter set RBSP is present that is not followed by a sequence parameter \nset extension RBSP with the same value of seq_parameter_set_id prior to the activation of the sequence parameter set \nRBSP, the sequence parameter set extension RBSP and its syntax elements shall be considered not present for the active \nMVCD sequence parameter set RBSP. The contents of sequence parameter set extension RBSPs only apply when the base \ntexture view, which conforms to one or more of the profiles specified in Annex A, of a coded video sequence conforming \nto one or more profiles specified in Annex I is decoded. Subset sequence parameter set RBSPs shall not be followed by a \nsequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nNOTE 4 \u2013 Sequence parameter sets extension RBSPs are not considered to be part of a subset sequence parameter set RBSP and \nsubset sequence parameter set RBSPs must not be followed by a sequence parameter set extension RBSP. \nFor view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the \nvalues of the syntax elements (and the values of variables derived from those syntax elements) in MVCD sequence \nparameter sets and picture parameter sets and other syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the \nactive MVCD sequence parameter set and the active picture parameter set. For view components with a particular value \nof VOIdx less than VOIdxMax, all constraints that are expressed on the relationship between the values of the syntax \nelements (and the values of variables derived from those syntax elements) in MVCD sequence parameter sets and picture \nparameter sets and other syntax elements are expressions of constraints that apply only to the active view MVCD sequence \nparameter set and the active view picture parameter set for the particular value of VOIdx. If any MVCD sequence parameter \nset RBSP having profile_idc equal to the value of one of the profile_idc values specified in Annex A or Annex H or Annex I \nis present that is never activated in the bitstream (i.e., it never becomes the active MVCD sequence parameter set or an \nactive view MVCD sequence parameter set), its syntax elements shall have values that would conform to the specified \nconstraints if it were activated by reference in an otherwise-conforming bitstream. If any picture parameter set RBSP is \npresent that is never activated in the bitstream (i.e., it never becomes the active picture parameter set or an active view \npicture parameter set), its syntax elements shall have values that would conform to the specified constraints if it were \nactivated by reference in an otherwise-conforming bitstream. \nDuring operation of the decoding process (see clause I.8), for view components with VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, the \nvalues of parameters of the active picture parameter set and the active MVCD sequence parameter set shall be considered \nin effect. For view components with a particular value of VOIdx less than VOIdxMax, the values of the parameters of the \nactive view picture parameter set and the active view MVCD sequence parameter set for the particular value of VOIdx \nshall be considered in effect. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply to the entire access unit or the view component \nwith VOIdx equal to VOIdxMax, the values of the parameters of the active picture parameter set and the active MVCD \nsequence parameter set for the same access unit shall be considered in effect unless otherwise specified in the SEI message \nsemantics. For interpretation of SEI messages that apply to view components with a particular value of VOIdx less than \nVOIdxMax, the values of the parameters of the active view picture parameter set and the active view MVCD sequence \nparameter set for the particular value of VOIdx for the same access unit shall be considered in effect unless otherwise \nspecified in the SEI message semantics. \nFor any active MVCD sequence parameter set or active view MVCD sequence parameter set, part of the syntax elements \nin the MVC sequence parameter set extension applies only to the depth views referring to this sequence parameter set, \nwhile the some other parts of the syntax elements in the MVCD sequence parameter set extension collectively apply to \nboth the depth views referring to this sequence parameter set and the corresponding texture views. More specifically, the \nview dependency information of the MVCD sequence parameter set extension applies only to the depth views, and the \nlevel definitions collectively apply to operation points, each of which contains both depth views and their corresponding \ntexture views. Moreover, the mvcd_vui_parameters_extension( ) applies collectively to both the depth views referring to \nthis MVCD sequence parameter set and the corresponding texture views. The vui_parameters( ) included in the sequence \nparameter set data syntax structure, if present, apply collectively to both the depth views referring to this sequence \nparameter set and the corresponding texture views, except for the aspect ratio information and the bitstream restriction \ninformation, if present, which apply only to the depth views referring to this MVCD sequence parameter set. The aspect \nratio information and the bitstream restriction information for the texture views may be present in the vui_parameters( ) \nsyntax structure included in an MVC sequence parameter set. \nI.7.4.1.2.2  Order of access units and association to coded video sequences \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.2 apply. \nI.7.4.1.2.3  Order of NAL units and coded pictures and association to access units \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.3 applies with the following modifications. \n \n\nNOTE \u2013 Some bitstreams that conform to one or more profiles specified in this annex do not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A (prior to operation of the base view extraction process specified in clause I.8.5.4). As specified in clauses 7.4.1 \nand 7.4.1.2.3 for the profiles specified in Annex A, NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 21 are classified as non-VCL NAL units \nthat must be preceded within each access unit by at least one NAL unit with nal_unit_type in the range of 1 to 5, inclusive. For this \nreason, any bitstream that conforms to one or more profiles specified in this annex does not conform to any profile specified in \nAnnex A when it contains any of the following: \n\u2013  any access unit that does not contain any NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5, but contains one or more NAL units \nwith nal_unit_type equal to 6, 7, 8, 9, or 15 \n\u2013  any access unit in which one or more NAL units with nal_unit_type equal to 7, 8, or 15 is present after the last NAL unit in the \naccess unit with nal_unit_type equal to 1 or 5. \nThe association of VCL NAL units to primary or redundant coded pictures is specified in clause I.7.4.1.2.5. \nThe constraints for the detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture are specified in clause I.7.4.1.2.4. \nThe constraint expressed in clause H.7.4.1.2.3 on the order of a buffering period SEI message is replaced by the following \nconstraints. \n\u2013  When an SEI NAL unit containing a buffering period SEI message is present, the following applies: \n\u2013  If the buffering period SEI message is the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit and it is not \nincluded in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message or an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, the buffering \nperiod SEI message shall be the first SEI message payload of the first SEI NAL unit in the access unit. \n\u2013  Otherwise (the buffering period SEI message is not the only buffering period SEI message in the access unit or \nit is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message or it is included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI \nmessage), the following constraints are specified: \n\u2013  When a buffering period SEI message that is not included in either an MVC scalable nesting SEI message \nor an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message is present, this buffering period SEI message shall be the only \nSEI message payload of the first SEI NAL unit in the access unit. \n\u2013  An MVC scalable nesting SEI message that includes a buffering period SEI message shall not include any \nother SEI messages and shall be the only SEI message inside the SEI NAL unit. \n\u2013  An MVCD scalable nesting SEI message that includes a buffering period SEI message shall not include any \nother SEI messages and shall be the only SEI message inside the SEI NAL unit. \n\u2013  All SEI NAL units that precede an SEI NAL unit that contains an MVC scalable nesting SEI message with \na buffering period SEI message as payload, or an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message with a buffering \nperiod SEI message as payload in an access unit shall only contain buffering period SEI messages or MVC \nscalable nesting SEI messages with a buffering period SEI message as payload, or MVCD scalable nesting \nSEI messages with a buffering period SEI message. \nI.7.4.1.2.4  Detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.4 applies. \nI.7.4.1.2.5  Order of VCL NAL units and association to coded pictures \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.5 applies with following modifications. \nEach VCL NAL unit is part of a coded picture. \nLet voIdx be the value of VOIdx of any particular VCL NAL unit. The order of the VCL NAL units within a coded picture \nis constrained as follows: \n\u2013  For all VCL NAL units following this particular VCL NAL unit, the value of VOIdx shall be greater than or equal \nto voIdx. \n\u2013  All VCL NAL units for a depth view component, if present, shall follow any VCL NAL unit of a texture view \ncomponent with a same value of VOIdx. \nFor each set of VCL NAL units within a texture or depth view component, the following applies: \n\u2013  If arbitrary slice order, as specified in Annex A, clause H.10 or clause I.10, is allowed, coded slice NAL units of a \nview component may have any order relative to each other. \n\u2013  Otherwise (arbitrary slice order is not allowed), coded slice NAL units of a slice group shall not be interleaved with \ncoded slice NAL units of another slice group and the order of coded slice NAL units within a slice group shall be in \nthe order of increasing macroblock address for the first macroblock of each coded slice NAL unit of the same slice \ngroup. \n \n\nThe following applies: \n\u2013  If a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is the first field view component of a complementary \nfield pair, the depth view component with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame \nview component or the first field view component of a complementary field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is the second field view component of a \ncomplementary field pair, the depth view component with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall \nbe the second field view component of a complementary field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is a non-paired field, the depth view \ncomponent with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame view component or a \nnon-paired field. \n\u2013  Otherwise (a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is a coded frame), the depth view component \nwith the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame view component. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 12 may be present in the access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL \nunit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive, which are unspecified, may be present in \nthe access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type in the range of 22 to 23, inclusive, which are reserved, shall not precede the first VCL \nNAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit (when specified in the future by ITU-T | ISO/IEC). \nI.7.4.2  Raw byte sequence payloads and RBSP trailing bits semantics \nI.7.4.2.1  Sequence parameter set RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1 apply. \nI.7.4.2.1.1  Sequence parameter set data semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause H.7.4.2.1.1 apply with the substitution of MVCD sequence parameter set for MVC \nsequence parameter set. All constraints specified in clause H.7.4.2.1.1 apply only to the texture view components for which \nthe MVCD sequence parameter set is the active texture MVC sequence parameter set or to the depth view components for \nwhich the MVCD sequence parameter set is the active view MVC sequence parameter set as specified in clause I.7.4.1.2.1. \nI.7.4.2.1.1.1 Scaling list semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause H.7.4.2.1.1.1 apply. \nI.7.4.2.1.2  Sequence parameter set extension RBSP semantics \nThe semantics specified in clause 7.4.2.1.2 apply.

When payloadType is equal to 10 for the SEI \nmessage that is included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message, the semantics for sub_seq_layer_num of the \nsub-sequence information SEI message is modified as follows: \nsub_seq_layer_num specifies the sub-sequence layer number of the current picture. When the current \npicture resides in a sub-sequence for which the first picture in decoding order is an IDR picture, the value \nof sub_seq_layer_num shall be equal to 0. For a non-paired reference field, the value of sub_seq_layer_num \nshall be equal to 0. sub_seq_layer_num shall be in the range of 0 to 255, inclusive. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if not included in an MVC scalable nesting SEI message and included in an MVCD scalable nesting \nSEI message, it applies to all depth view components or view component pairs of the current access unit when \nall_view_components_in_au_flag is equal to 1, or it applies to all depth view components or view component \npairs  of  the  current  access  unit  with  view_id  equal  to  sei_view_id[ i ]  for  any  i  in  the  range  of 0  to \nnum_view_components_minus1,  inclusive,  when  all_view_components_in_au_flag  is  equal  to 0.  When \npayloadType is equal to 10 for the SEI message that is included in an MVCD scalable nesting SEI message, the \nsemantics for sub_seq_layer_num of the sub-sequence information SEI message is modified as follows: \nsub_seq_layer_num specifies the sub-sequence layer number of the current picture.

A reference displays information message \ncontains information about the reference display width(s) and reference viewing distance(s) as well as information about \nthe corresponding baseline distance(s) and additional horizontal image shift(s), which form a stereo-pair for the reference \ndisplay width and the reference viewing distance. This information enables a view renderer to produce a proper stereo-pair \nfor the target screen width and the viewing distance. The reference display width and viewing distance values are signalled \nin units of centimetres. The reference baseline values shall be signalled in the same units as the x component of the \ntranslation vector in the multiview acquisition information SEI message that is valid for the same access unit. When a \nreference displays information SEI message is present in an access unit, the multiview acquisition information SEI message \nshall also be present in the same access unit. The baseline and shift information signalled for the reference display is valid \nfor all access units they associated with and until the next IDR access unit or the next access unit containing multiview \nacquisition information SEI message or reference displays information SEI message. \nNOTE \u2013 The reference displays information SEI message specifies display parameters for which the 3D sequence was optimized \nand the corresponding reference parameters. Each reference display (i.e. a reference display width and possibly a corresponding \nviewing distance) is associated with one reference baseline distance. \nThe following formulas can be used for calculating the baseline distance and horizontal shift for the receiver's display when the \nratio between the receiver's viewing distance and the reference viewing distance is the same as the ratio between the receiver screen \nwidth and the reference screen width: \n      baseline = ref_baseline * ( ref_display_width \u00f7 display_width ) \n      shift = ref_shift * ( ref_display_width \u00f7 display_width ) \nIn the provided formulas, the width of the visible part of the display used for showing the video sequence should be understood \nunder \"display width\". The same formulas can also be used for choosing the baseline distance and horizontal shift in cases when \nthe viewing distance is not scaled proportionally to the screen width compared to the reference display parameters. In this case, the \neffect of applying these formulas would be to keep the perceived depth in the same proportion to the viewing distance as in the \nreference setup. \nWhen camera parameters are updated by a multiview acquisition information SEI message in a following access unit and the \nbaseline between the views used in the view synthesis process in the following access unit changes relative to that in the in the \naccess unit which the reference displays information SEI belongs to, the baseline and the horizontal shift for the receiver's display \nin the following access unit should be modified accordingly. Let the scaling factor s be equal to the ratio of the baseline between \ntwo views in the following access unit and the baseline between the same two views in the access unit, which the reference displays \ninformation SEI message belongs to, where the two views are used in the view synthesis process. Then the baseline distance for \nthe receiver's display in the following access unit should be modified with the scaling factor s relative to the baseline distance for \n \n\nthe receiver's display in the access unit which the reference displays information SEI belongs to. The horizontal shift for the \nreceiver's display should also be modified by scaling it with the same factor as that used to scale the baseline distance. \nprec_ref_baseline specifies the exponent of the maximum allowable truncation error for ref_baseline[ i ] as given by \n2\u2212prec_ref_baseline.

The depth timing SEI message may be present in any access unit \nand it pertains until the end of the coded video sequence or until the next depth timing SEI message, whichever is earlier \nin decoding order. The access units that the message pertains to are referred to as the target access unit set. \nper_view_depth_timing_flag equal to 0 specifies that all the depth view components within the target access unit set have \nthe same acquisition time offset relative to the DPB output time of the respective access unit in the target access unit set. \nThe single occurrence of the depth_timing_offset structure specifies this acquisition time offset. \nper_view_depth_timing_flag equal to 1 specifies that a depth_timing_offset syntax structure is present for each depth view \nin ascending order of view order index values for the depth views and specifies the acquisition time offset for that view. \nI.13.2.5.1  Depth timing offset semantics \noffset_len_minus1 specifies the length of the depth_disp_delay_offset_fp syntax element. \ndepth_disp_delay_offset_fp and depth_disp_delay_offset_dp specify that the acquisition offset of the respective depth \nview component or components relative to the DPB output time of the access unit containing the depth view component \nor components is equal to depth_disp_delay_offset_fp \u00f7 2depth_disp_delay_offset_dp in units of clock ticks as specified in Annex C. \nThe length of depth_disp_delay_offset_fp syntax element is equal to offset_len_minus1 + 1. \nIf depth_disp_delay_offset_fp is not present, it is inferred to be equal to 0.

The related output view is not suitable to be displayed directly. This \nSEI message can be used by the application after the decoder output to rearrange the samples to produce additional views \nthat are appropriate for display or use by a server for other purposes (which are outside the scope of this Recommendation | \nInternational Standard). \nWhen the alternative depth information SEI message is present, the texture and depth views referred to by this SEI message \nshall  conform  to  the  specifications  in  Annexes  I  and  J,  ChromaArrayType  shall  be  equal  to  1  (4:2:0), \nbit_depth_luma_minus8 shall be equal to 0, bit_depth_chroma_minus8 shall be equal to 0, and the depth representation \ninformation SEI message shall be present. The depth_representation_type is defined in the depth representation information \nSEI message. The depth representation is only carried in the luma component. \nThe alternative depth information SEI message, when present, shall be associated with an IDR access unit. The information \nsignalled in this SEI message applies to all the access units in the coded video sequence.

The base view is a complete view and the non-base view \ncontains a packing arrangement of 1 to 4 additional views with half the width and half the height of the base view. Such \nlower-resolution views are referred to as constituent pictures herein. \nNOTE 2 \u2013 The view_id of the non-base view is not used in any particular way for this SEI message. \nAll  constituent  pictures  have  a  width  and  a  height  equal  to  ( ( pic_width_in_mbs_minus1  +  1 )  *  8 )  and \n( ( pic_height_in_map_unit_minus1 + 1 ) * 8 ) in luma samples, respectively. frame_mbs_only_flag shall be equal to 1. \nThe variable i, with a value from 0 to num_constituent_views_gvd_minus1 + 1, inclusive, indicates the location of the \nconstituent pictures in the non-base texture view as specified in Table I-4. i equal to 0 indicates the base texture view. i \ngreater than 0 indicates the constituent texture view. \n \n\nTable I-4 \u2013  Locations of the top-left luma samples of constituent pictures packed in a non-base texture view \nrelative to the top-left luma sample of this picture \n \nConstituent picture index i  Location of the top-left luma sample in a non-base texture view \n1  ( 0, 0 ) \n2  ( 0, ( pic_height_in_map_unit_minus1 + 1 ) * 8 ) \n3  ( ( pic_width_in_mbs_minus1 + 1 ) * 8, 0 ) \n4  ( (pic_width_in_mbs_minus1 + 1 ) * 8, ( pic_height_in_map_unit_minus1 + 1 ) * 8 ) \n \nThe decoded depth views have the same structure as the decoded texture views, i.e., they consist of a base depth view (i \nequal to 0) and a non-base depth view. The non-base depth view contains up to four constituent depth pictures (i in the \nrange of 1 to 4) for the constituent views. The constituent depth pictures are packed in the non-base depth view in the same \narrangement as the constituent texture pictures as specified in Table I-4. \nThis arrangement of texture and depth constituent views is referred to as global view and depth (GVD) information. \ndepth_type shall be equal to 0.

The depth component of the base view shall always be present, independent of the \nvalue of depth_present_gvd_flag. \nNOTE 3 \u2013 The following SEI message parameters can be used along with the decoded depth components to project samples from \nthe base view into the coordinates of constituent views such that reconstructed views can be generated by combining projected \nsamples and samples from the constituent views. \nThe function binToFp( s, e, n, v ) is specified as follows: \nbinToFp( s, e, n, v ) = ( \u22121 )s * ( e  = =  0 ?

elements within these structures (in clause J.7.3 and in \nclause I.7.3 by reference in clause J.7.3) are specified in this clause and by reference to clause I.7.4. When the semantics \nof a syntax element are specified using a table or a set of tables, any values that are not specified in the table(s) shall not \nbe present in the bitstream unless otherwise specified in this Recommendation | International Standard. \nJ.7.4.1  NAL unit semantics \nThe semantics for the syntax elements clause J.7.3.1 are specified in clause I.7.3.1. \nJ.7.4.1.1  NAL unit header MVC extension semantics \nview_idx specifies the view oder index for the NAL unit. \nview_id is inferred to be equal to view_id[ view_idx ], where view_id[ ] is present in the active sequence parameter set. \nThe variable VOIdx, representing the view order index of the view identified by view_id[ i ], is set equal to view_idx. \ndepth_flag equal to 1 indicates that the current NAL unit belongs to a depth view component, depth_flag equal to 0 \nindicates that the current NAL unit belongs to a texture view component. \nnon_idr_flag, temporal_id, anchor_pic_flag, and inter_view_flag have the same semantics as those syntax elements \nwith the same names in Annex H. \nJ.7.4.1.2  Order of NAL units and association to coded pictures, access units, and video sequences \nThe specification of clause I.7.4.1.2 applies. \nJ.7.4.1.2.1  Order of 3D-AVC sequence parameter set RBSPs and picture parameter set RBSPs and their \nactivation \nThe specification of clause I.7.4.1.2.1 applies. \nIn addition, the following applies for the activation of depth parameter set. \nA depth parameter set includes parameters that can be referred to by the coded slice NAL units of one or more texture view \nor depth view components of one or more coded pictures. A depth parameter set associated with depth_parameter_set_id \nequal to 0 contains the depth ranges syntax structure and the view synthesis prediction parameter syntax structure included \nin the active sequence parameter set. A depth parameter set with depth_parameter_set_id greater than 0 is a depth parameter \nset RBSP with that depth_parameter_set_id value. \nEach depth parameter set is initially considered not active at the start of the operation of the decoding process. At most one \ndepth parameter set is considered as the active depth parameter set at any given moment during the operation of the \n \n\ndecoding process, and when any particular depth parameter set becomes the active depth parameter set, the previously-\nactive depth parameter set (if any) is deactivated. \nWhen a depth parameter set (with a particular value of depth_parameter_set_id) is not the active depth parameter set and \nit is referred to by a coded slice NAL unit (when dps_id is present in a slice header), it is activated. This depth parameter \nset is called the active depth parameter set until it is deactivated when another depth parameter set becomes the active \ndepth parameter set. A depth parameter set, with that particular value of depth_parameter_set_id, shall be available to the \ndecoding process prior to its activation. When a depth parameter set is activated, the same depth parameter set shall remain \nactive for subsequent coded slice NAL units of the same access unit. \nIf any depth parameter set is present that is never activated in the bitstream (i.e., it never becomes the active depth parameter \nset), its syntax elements shall have values that would conform to the specified constraints if it were activated by reference \nin an otherwise-conforming bitstream. \nJ.7.4.1.2.2  Order of access units and association to coded video sequences \nThe specification of clause I.7.4.1.2.2 apply. \nJ.7.4.1.2.3  Order of NAL units and coded pictures and association to access units \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.3 applies with the following modifications. \nThe association of VCL NAL units to primary or redundant coded pictures is specified in clause I.7.4.1.2.5. \nJ.7.4.1.2.4  Detection of the first VCL NAL unit of a primary coded picture \nThe specification of clause H.7.4.1.2.4 applies. \nJ.7.4.1.2.5  Order of VCL NAL units and association to coded pictures \nEach VCL NAL unit is part of a coded picture. \nLet voIdx be the value of VOIdx of any particular VCL NAL unit. The order of the VCL NAL units within a coded picture \nis constrained as follows: \n\u2013  For all VCL NAL units following this particular VCL NAL unit, the value of VOIdx shall be greater than or equal \nto voIdx. \n\u2013  All VCL NAL units for a depth view component, if present, shall follow any VCL NAL unit of an MVC texture \nview component with a same value of VOIdx. \nFor each set of VCL NAL units within a texture or depth view component, the following applies: \n\u2013  If arbitrary slice order, as specified in Annex A, clause H.10, clause I.10 or clause J.10, is allowed, coded slice NAL \nunits of a view component may have any order relative to each other. \n\u2013  Otherwise (arbitrary slice order is not allowed), coded slice NAL units of a slice group shall not be interleaved with \ncoded slice NAL units of another slice group and the order of coded slice NAL units within a slice group shall be in \nthe order of increasing macroblock address for the first macroblock of each coded slice NAL unit of the same slice \ngroup. \nThe following applies: \n\u2013  If a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is the first field view component of a complementary \nfield pair, the depth view component with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame \nview component or the first field view component of a complementary field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is the second field view component of a \ncomplementary field pair, the depth view component with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall \nbe the second field view component of a complementary field pair. \n\u2013  Otherwise, if a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is a non-paired field, the depth view \ncomponent with the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame view component or a \nnon-paired field. \n\u2013  Otherwise (a coded texture view component with a particular view_id is a coded frame), the depth view component \nwith the same view_id value, if present in the access unit, shall be a coded frame view component. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 12 may be present in the access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL \nunit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \nNAL units having nal_unit_type equal to 0 or in the range of 24 to 31, inclusive, which are unspecified, may be present in \nthe access unit but shall not precede the first VCL NAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit. \n \n\nNAL units having nal_unit_type in the range of 22 to 23, inclusive, which are reserved, shall not precede the first VCL \nNAL unit of the primary coded picture within the access unit (when specified in the future by ITU-T | ISO/IEC). \nJ.7.4.2  Raw byte sequence payloads and RBSP trailing bits semantics \nJ.7.4.2.1  Sequence parameter set RBSP semantics \nThe
